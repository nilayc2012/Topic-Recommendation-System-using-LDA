Historical background.
Estonia as a unified political entity first emerged after the Russian February Revolution of 1917. With the collapse of the Russian Empire in World War I, Russia's provisional government granted national autonomy to a unified Estonia in April. The Governorate of Estonia in the north (corresponding to the historic Danish Estonia) was united with the northern part of the Governorate of Livonia. Elections for a provisional parliament, "Maapäev", were organized. On 5 November 1917, two days before the October Revolution in Saint Petersburg, Estonian Bolshevik leader Jaan Anvelt violently usurped power from the legally constituted Maapäev in a coup d'état, forcing the Maapäev underground.
After the collapse of the peace talks between Soviet Russia and the German Empire in February 1918, mainland Estonia was occupied by the Germans, with Bolshevik forces retreating to Russia. Between the Russian Red Army's retreat and the arrival of advancing German troops, the Salvation Committee of the Estonian National Council Maapäev issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence. in Pärnu on 24 February 1918. After the withdrawal of German troops in November 1918, the Estonian provisional government retook office. A military invasion by Red Army followed a few days later, however, marking the beginning of the Estonian War of Independence (1918–1920). The Estonian army cleared the Red Army from Estonia by February 1919.
On 5–7 April 1919 The Estonian Constituent Assembly was elected. On 2 February 1920, the Treaty of Tartu was signed by the Republic of Estonia and Russian SFSR. The terms of the treaty stated that Russia renounced in perpetuity all rights to the territory of Estonia. The first Constitution of Estonia was adopted on 15 June 1920. The Republic of Estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the League of Nations in 1921.
