 <p>USS "Gendreau" (DE-639) was a in the United States Navy. She was commissioned on 17 March 1944 and decommissioned on 13 March 1948. She served throughout the Pacific during World War II. 
Canadian-born Captain Elphege A. M. Gendreau (1888–1943) served as Force Surgeon of Battle Force and on the staff of Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet. Admiral Nimitz recommended that a ship be named in honor of the surgeon for his dedicated service, after Capt. Gendreau was killed in a dive-bombing attack while onboard USS LST 343 in the South Pacific 21 July 1943. 
"Gendreau" was laid down on 1 August 1943 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., San Francisco; launched on 12 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Josephine Gendreau, widow of Captain E. A. M. Gendreau, with Mrs. Chester W. Nimitz, wife of the Commander in Chief of Pacific Fleet, as matron of honor. "Gendreau" was commissioned on 17 March 1944, with Lieutenant Commander A. D. Kilmartin in command.
Service history.
Convoy escort.
After shakedown off the California coast, "Gendreau" departed San Francisco, California, on 23 May 1944 escorting a convoy to Pearl Harbor, arriving six days later. She trained in Hawaiian waters and got underway on 18 June 1944 on the first of two voyages, escorting convoys between Hawaii and the Marshalls. Convoy duty brought her to Eniwetok again and on 26 July 1944. "Gendreau" returned to Oahu from the second voyage in time to help welcome President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Hawaii. During an ensuing anti-submarine patrol out of Pearl Harbor, the destroyer escort rescued the pilot and crew of an aircraft which had ditched at sea on 31 July 1944; and nine days later in heavy seas saved a downed fighter pilot.
"Gendreau" departed Pearl Harbor on 8 September 1944, with a convoy for Emirau. On 13 September 1944, she collided with escort carrier while fueling from her in heavy seas; but efficient emergency repairs allowed "Gendreau" to proceed with the convoy to Emirau before steaming into Manus on 19 September 1944 for repairs. She sailed from the Admiralties on 1 October 1944 and arrived at Port Purvis, Solomon Islands, on 4 October 1944. Following intensive training with PT boats at Tulagi, she sailed on 27 October 1944 for the Russell Islands and rendezvoused with a convoy of landing craft bound for New Georgia Island. Departing on 29 October 1944, the group proceeded to Cape Torokina, Bougainville, where the landing craft debarked troops. "Gendreau" escorted the landing craft back to the Russells on 1 November 1944, and returned to Port Purvis the next day.
From 17 February through 20 February 1945, "Gendreau" was in dry dock, being repaired by its seamen and members of the repair ship . Lieutenant Martin Victor became captain of "Gendreau" at this time. 
In March 1945, following three months of escort and ASW duty shuttling between islands of the South Pacific, "Gendreau" rehearsed for the coming Okinawa invasion after which she escorted landing craft to the Russell Islands and Port Purvis, arriving at Port Purvis on 7 March 1945, and returning to the Russells four days later. Underway from the Russells on 12 March 1945, she called at Ulithi on 21 March 1945 for final staging and sortied four days later with a task force for the Ryukyus. 
Invasion of Okinawa.
On L-Day, 1 April 1945, "Gendreau" was off the southeast coast of Okinawa protecting amphibious ships. Before dawn a Japanese plane attacked the DE but was shot down and crashed a few yards to starboard. A few hours later she closed the invasion beaches and delivered the landing craft to their assigned positions well in advance of the final bombardment and initial landings. The next day she was in the destroyer screen when another enemy plane attacked her at dawn, but with the aid of other ships she managed to shoot it down. On 3 April 1945, a plane strafed her and then, on its second pass, tried to crash her, but "Gendreau"s gunfire blew it out of the air and the plane crashed 25 yards (23 m) away. On 5 April 1945 she joined a hunter-killer group. 
On 6 April 1945, a torpedo bomber aimed a torpedo at the DE, but it exploded upon hitting the water. "Gendreau" shot down the bomber astern. The following day she destroyed another attacking plane. On 12 April 1945, without warning, a torpedo bomber roared in and released a torpedo which passed just under the bow and exploded some distance beyond. On 16 April 1945, two enemy planes homed in on her, but two American fighters swooped in from behind and shot down the attackers.
"Gendreau" departed Okinawa on 22 April 1945 with a convoy, touching at Saipan five days later and returning to Okinawa on 2 May 1945. She departed the next day for Ulithi, arriving there on 7 May 1945. Underway again on 23 May 1945 with a mixed convoy, she called at Okinawa on 29 May 1945 and escorted convoys in these waters. On 10 June 1945, while supporting the American troops who were wresting the island from Japan, "Gendreau" was hit by shellfire from a hidden 150 mm (5.9 in) gun. She lost power and began taking water, but outstanding damage control had her under control in 15 minutes and nearly restored her to normal within two hours. Two men were killed and two others wounded.
East China Sea.
After repairs at Kerama Retto and later at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, she joined Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Task Force on 13 July 1945, for training and minesweeping in the East China Sea. On 26 July 1945 she rescued a friendly fighter pilot who had ditched at sea, picking him up only 32 minutes after the crash. At the end of the month a bad typhoon caused her to roll nearly 60° and buckled steel plating. On 31 July 1945 she escorted damaged battleship to Guam and returned to Okinawa on 12 September 1945, where four days later, another typhoon parted her port anchor chain. She departed on 22 September 1945 to act as courier ship during the Allied occupation of the Japanese homeland.
Thus, after a short but distinguished war career, "Gendreau" stood out of Tokyo Bay on 4 November 1945 bound home via Pearl Harbor, arriving at Portland, Oregon on 22 November 1945. Around this time, the departing captain of "Gendreau", Lieutenant Commander Martin Victor, gave the following farewell address to the crew:
Post-war activities.
In February 1946 she proceeded to San Diego for training exercises and then departed the following month on a Far Eastern cruise. "Gendreau" arrived at Shanghai, China, on 14 April 1946, and sailed to Hulutato, Manchuria, and then to Tsingtao and Chinwangtao, China. Further patrols brought her to Okinawa and Shanghai again May to June, and on 1 July 1946 she headed for California, arriving at San Diego on 19 July 1946. After training and repairs, she cast off on her last Far Eastern cruise, calling at Pearl Harbor and Guam en route to Japan.
"Gendreau" arrived in Japan on 19 March 1947. In the spring and summer of 1947, "Gendreau" stood patrol duty off the Korean coast, calling at Yokosuka, Japan on 21 May 1947, and thence returning to station. On 1 September 1947, she sailed from Japan for Pearl Harbor and San Diego, putting in at the latter port 19 September 1947.
Decommissioning and sale.
"Gendreau" decommissioned on 13 March 1948 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego. "Gendreau" was stricken on 1 December 1972. "Gendreau" was sold on 11 September 1973 and broken up for scrap.
