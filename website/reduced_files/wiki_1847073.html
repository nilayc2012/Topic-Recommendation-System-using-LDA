<h1>Concordat of 2002</h1>
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=15698042'>Wikipedia Link</a>
 <p>The Constitutional Agreement between the Georgian state and the Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Georgia (), informally referred to as the Concordat, is an agreement between the Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC) and the state that defines relations between the two entities. It was signed by President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze and Patriarch of Georgia Ilia II on October 14, 2002 at the Cathedral of the Living Pillar in Mtskheta, Georgia.
The Georgian Orthodox Church is the only officially recognized religious denomination in Georgia. Although other minorities such as Catholics and Muslims have the freedom to exercise their religion, they can officially register their religious groups only as organizations, and not as churches. Moreover, while there are other smaller branches of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Georgia such as the Russian Orthodox, they are all subject to the jurisdiction of the GOC on all territory of the Georgian state.
