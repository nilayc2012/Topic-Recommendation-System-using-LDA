 <p>Norðdepil (pronounced ; ) is a town on the east coast of the island of Borðoy in the Norðoyar Region of the Faroe Islands.
History.
Norðdepil was founded in 1866. Its school opened in 1895.
August 18, 1941 around noon, a German Junker Ju 88, crashed, in heavy fog, into the mountainside above the village.
Norðdepil has been connected with the town of Hvannasund on Viðoy by a dike with a road on top since 1963. Because the two communities are located directly across from each other on opposite shores, they often act as one community.<br>
Since 1967, two single-lane tunnels have connected Norðdepil with the regional city of Klaksvík.
Immediately bordering Norðdepil to its north is the abandoned settlement Fossá, of which nothing remains. Fossá was named after some waterfalls.<br>
Further north on the east coast of Borðoy there is a road going from Norðdepil to the abandoned hamlet Múli.
Whaling Station.
In 1897 the whaling station Norddeble was constructed by "Andorsen & Neumann," but whaling activity didn't start until 1898. Among the first owners was Peder Michelsen who had been an accomplished gunner on the boat Urd, with Grøn at Gjánoyri. And for the first time we see the company "Chr. Salvesen & Co" in the Faroes, the company which later started up the station Við Áir. The station started with one boat Norddeble.
The well known Faroese Sverri Patursson was one trip with Norddeble in 1899.
The station was only active part of the first season 1898, but 54 whales were shot, which gave 1316 barrels of whale oil, in 1899 the station processed about 60 whales, of these were 26 blue whales, and got around 1700 barrels.
The first four years, the station only had the boat Norddeble, in August 1902 the station bought a second boat.
1906 was a bad year for all stations, and only Norddeble managed to produce more than 2000 barrels. 1907 was better and the station produced 2600 barrels, the good weather that season had a lot to say for the end result.
Michelsen was lost at sea 28 December 1910 in Antarctica, and the company stopped whaling activities at Norðdepli in 1912. The station was sold to A/S Suderø, who attempted whaling in the season 1920, but it failed completely, and the station closed down.
