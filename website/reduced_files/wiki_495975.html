 <p>The Republican Socio-Political Movement Equality ("Mişcare Social-Politică Republicană Ravnopravie") is a left-of-centre political party in Moldova. At the legislative election, on 6 March 2005, the party won 3.8% of the popular vote, but no seats. The party's political program seems to indicate a pro-Russian stance in relation to foreign policy, as the opening paragraphs of the document make the claim that "quality of life of citizens" was superior under the Soviet Union and that Moldova's socio-economic problems relate to Moldova's negative relationship with the Russian Federation .
