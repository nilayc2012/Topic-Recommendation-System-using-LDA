Women's wing.
The APTUF is unique in Pakistan because of the strength of its women's wing. The Women's Wing of the APTUF works to mobilize women workers on trade union platforms.
The women leaders in the APTUF have faced many threats from both religious extremists and the government. Although Pakistan does not permit women to participate directly in trade union activities, the Women's Wing uses the strategy of involving family members in the unions to serve as spokespeople for the women. The Pakistani Working Women Organization (WWO) is an
independent organization that collaborates with and supports the APTUF.
Work with other unions and international links.
The APTUF is Member of Pakistan Workers Confederation and works closely with the International Liaison Committee for a Workers' International based in Paris, France. The APTUF has established close cooperation with other independent pro-workers trade union federations, both in Asia and across the world. These ties serve to promote friendship and the exchange of information, as well as voice solidarity towards other struggles in the labor movement.
