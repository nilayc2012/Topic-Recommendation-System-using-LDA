 <p>The Lupertazzi crime family is a fictional Mafia family from the HBO series "The Sopranos." It is thought to be loosely based on the real Lucchese and Gambino crime families.
The Lupertazzi crime family consists of an administration and various crews, but only eight crews are known.
The following is a listing of fictional characters from "The Sopranos" that are associated with the Lupertazzi crime family.
Lupertazzi crime family overview.
History.
The Lupertazzi crime family is a major partner of the DiMeo crime family and one of the Five Families. They are larger and more powerful than the DiMeo family. It is assumed that the other crime families in New York are fictional; however, there have been references to real-life mob figures Joe Profaci, John Gotti, Joe Massino and Paul Castellano as well as to the Colombo crime family. At least three or four other families are known of; the Teresi family, the Mangano family (which historically was headed by Vincent Mangano, a forerunner of the Gambino crime family), and the Paglieri family. One was run by George Paglieri until his retirement, and another is controlled by John Sacrimoni's brother-in-law, Andy, whose last name and family is not known. He may be the brother of Ginny Sacrimoni and Anthony Infante, or the husband of an unnamed sister of John's. Due to its large size, the Lupertazzi crime family likely represents either the Gambino, Genovese or Lucchese crime families.
The Lupertazzi family is based in Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island (as well as having at least one crew operating out of Florida). The family was headed by Carmine Lupertazzi, Sr. until his death in 2004. The Lupertazzi family is known for their close dealings with the DiMeo crime family, particularly on the esplanade construction site and HUD projects in Newark, New Jersey. The Lupertazzi family consists of around 200 soldiers.
The Lupertazzi family has gone through some internal friction over the years, with Boss Carmine Lupertazzi and his underboss, John "Johnny Sack" Sacramoni, each reaching out to North Jersey Boss Tony Soprano to perform a hit on the other. Neither hit ended up being carried out. The family fell into disarray after Carmine Sr.'s death when his son, "Little" Carmine Lupertazzi, came up from Florida to try and take control from Johnny Sack, who had been eyeing the top position for years. Key crews in the family split loyalties: capos Phil Leotardo and Jimmy Petrille sided with Johnny Sack in the conflict, while capos Rusty Millio, Jerry Basile and consigliere Angelo Garepe sided with "Little" Carmine. Tony Soprano came to Johnny Sack with a compromise: there would be a power-sharing situation with Little Carmine, Johnny, and Angelo holding the title as boss and decisions being made with the consent of at least two bosses. Johnny Sack refused, insulted by the proposition.
Associates loyal to Little Carmine, Lorraine Calluzzo and Jason Evanina, were killed on the orders of Johnny Sack as punishment for kicking up to Little Carmine. As payback, Rusty and Angelo reached out to Tony Blundetto, an associate in the DiMeo crime family and cousin to Tony Soprano, to kill Joey "Peeps" Peparelli, an associate close to Johnny Sack. Phil and Billy Leotardo retaliated by stuffing Angelo inside a car and shooting him in the head. Tony B., a close friend of Garepe from their time in prison, then went after Phil, wounding him and killing Billy.
After the attacks on Garepe and the Leotardo brothers, Little Carmine retreated back to Florida. Johnny Sack was installed as official boss of the Lupertazzi family. His first order of business was to take revenge on Tony B., by means of torture and murder from Phil. Tony Soprano, unwilling to allow Phil to do that to his cousin, refused to give up Blundetto, who had gone into hiding. Leotardo responded by attacking Soprano associate Benny Fazio, sending him to the hospital with a skull fracture. Facing increased pressure from his own family, Tony shot and killed Tony B. himself with a shotgun blast to the head. Phil was outraged, but Johnny Sack met with Tony to re-establish business with the North Jersey Boss. At that meeting, the FBI raided Johnny Sack's home and arrested him. It was later revealed that Jimmy Petrille, prospective consigliere to Johnny Sack and a friend of his father, had given 18 years worth of information to the federal government.
With Johnny Sack in jail and awaiting trial, Phil Leotardo was named Acting Boss of the Lupertazzi family. Despite holding a grudge after the death of his brother and a minor incident involving Acting Capo Gerry Torciano and Hesh Rabkin, Phil maintained a working relationship with the Soprano family.
Johnny Sack, fearing another uprising from Rusty Millio, reached out to Tony Soprano through Phil to whack the rebellious capo. After refusing Phil, Tony agreed to put out the hit when Johnny talked to him at his daughter, Allegra's wedding (which Johnny was allowed to attend for six hours provided he pay for security costs). When the feds interrupted Allegra's wedding car to take Johnny back to prison, John burst into tears. Phil made it a point after the wedding to speak out on his diminished regard for his boss.
Tony Soprano made good on his promise to Johnny, and sent two men from Naples to whack Rusty Millio and soldier Eddie Pietro outside of his home. However, more tension arose between the two families when Phil's cousin-in-law and the captain of the top earning Aprile crew, Vito Spatafore, was outed as a homosexual.
In the winter of 2006, Boss John "Johnny Sack" Sacrimoni plead guilty to 47 RICO predicates, receiving a 15-year sentence. As part of the plea, he admitted that he was a member of "La Cosa Nostra". When hearing this, Lupertazzi family members denounced their boss, saying that he broke the vow of silence.
Becoming virtually the Boss of the Lupertazzi family, Phil immediately started flexing his power, renegotiating no-show jobs shared with the Soprano family and whacking Aprile crew captain Vito Spatafore before Tony could get the chance to settle things within his own family. In retaliation, Tony planned on hurting Phil financially, but his plans were complicated when Carlo Gervasi and Silvio Dante killed Dominic "Fat Dom" Gamiello, a soldier in the Lupertazzi family.
Tony Soprano officially responded to Vito's death by blowing up a Sheepshead Bay wire room operated by Phil Leotardo. Leotardo and his "comare" (mistress/lover) were approaching the business as it exploded but were unharmed.
Subsequently, a sit-down was arranged by Little Carmine Lupertazzi between Phil and Tony Soprano. A truce was almost agreed until Lupertazzi brought up the death of Leotardo's brother Billy Leotardo. Phil was enraged and left the sit-down after insulting both Soprano and Lupertazzi.
Later, Phil Leotardo convened a war council with consigliere Albie Cianflone, and captains Butch DeConcini and Gerry Torciano. DeConcini pushed hard for Tony Soprano, or someone high up in the Soprano family, to be whacked while Phil blanched at the thought of whacking a boss. However, Phil was hospitalized thereafter when he suffered a massive coronary. When Tony Soprano visited Phil in the hospital to make peace, he seemed receptive, but DeConcini was openly confrontational.
In late 2007, Phil returned to Brookyln after undergoing heart surgery and several months of physical therapy. He found the family in disarray under the highly controversial leadership of Faustino "Doc" Santoro. While there was some expectation that Phil would return to his position of boss, the stress of his heart attack had caused him to lose all interest in the job. Phil prepared to support his protegee Gerry Torciano in his bid for boss, and was emphatic in stressing that being a boss, 'health-wise, is a young man's game.' However, Leotardo's and Torciano's plans were ended when Santoro had Torciano murdered at a dinner with Soprano Family consilgiere Silvio Dante. The fact that Dante's life was imperiled prompted Tony Soprano to appeal to Little Carmine to take the reins as boss of the Lupertazzis. However, Little Carmine explained to Tony that during his war with Johnny, his wife had appealed to him to quit so that she would not lose him.
Although he had been boss only in name, the death of Johnny Sack further destabilized the Lupertazzi family as he left behind no clear successor. With his protegee and successor dead and Little Carmine unwilling to take over, Leotardo re-examined his motives and prepared to go to war with Santoro. After deciding to get back in the game, Phil bided his time, working under Doc Santoro until the old man's arrogance got too much to handle. Having enough, Phil ordered his soldiers to kill Santoro once and for all, so driven by Butch DeConcini, the hitmen murdered Santoro and an associate outside a massage parlor, leaving him dead on the sidewalk.
After Phil rejects Tony's offer of compromise on an asbestos removal project he then refuses to meet with Tony after he brutally beats one of Phil's men, Salvatore "Coco" Cogliano, for threatening Meadow Soprano. Phil responds by putting a hit on Tony Soprano and two of his closest associates, Bobby Baccalieri and Silvio. The hits on Bobby and Silvio go nearly as planned with Bobby killed and Silvio incapacitated. Tony and Paulie Gualtieri had a sitdown with Butch, Albie, and Little Carmine, brokered by NY Boss George Paglieri, to negotiate a peace. Unhappy with Phil's leadership, they allowed Tony to have Phil executed, though Butch refused to give the exact location of where Phil was. Phil was shot in the head by DiMeo soldier Walden Belfiore while he was exiting his family sport utility vehicle at a gas station. His wife, the driver, was so distraught that she exited the SUV while it the transmission was still in drive. The vehicle rolled forward, the passenger side rear wheel crushing Phil's head. His twin grandchildren, riding in car seats, were unharmed but for experiencing a slight bump. The new boss of the family is unknown, but most likely former underboss Butch DeConcini.

Capo in the Lupertazzi crime family. His crew is based in Freeport, Long Island.
Jerry Basile.
During the infighting following boss Carmine Lupertazzi's death in 2004, Little Carmine courted Jerry's loyalty with the gift of a washing machine and a visit to the Lupertazzi home. Basile was somewhat put off when Johnny Sack arranged to have Little Carmine's motoryacht - which was moored in the back of the house - sunk during Basile's visit. Jerry is the only Lupertazzi capo to retain that rank through the power struggle between Johnny Sack and Little Carmine.
"Petey B." is one of the soldiers/associates of the Lupertazzi crime family tasked with taking out Silvio Dante. He is driving the car with "Ray Ray" in it and successfully traps Dante and Patsy Parisi in the Bada Bing! parking lot. "Ray Ray" would have fired more at Silvio and perhaps gone after Patsy except that he ran out of bullets. Leaving the parking lot in a hurry, Petey accidentally causes a massive crash, wherein a motorcyclist falls from his bike and it hits other moving vehicles.
Petey B..
Petey B. is played by and named after Pete Bucossi, the stunt coordinator on the show ever since the pilot episode.
A famous associate of the Lupertazzi crime family, known as "the lady shylock." Christopher Moltisanti calls her a legend and is obviously impressed with the reputation she earned in spite of the handicap of being a woman in the mob. Junior Soprano noted her bloodthirstiness in days gone by. She once had a sexual relationship with Tony. During the infighting following boss Carmine Lupertazzi's death in 2004, Lorraine kicked up to Little Carmine, who was also reportedly her lover as well as her second cousin. This put her in the crosshairs of Johnny Sack's outfit, who wanted to set an example for the rest of the New York Crews. Phil Leotardo roughed her up and even shot at her (using a telephone directory to stop the bullet) during a shakedown, warning her to stop cutting in Little Carmine. Lorraine sought a sit down with Tony Soprano through Angelo Garepe to ask him to intercede in the Lupertazzi infighting. But Phil returns with his brother Billy and associate Joseph "Joey Peeps" Peparelli, killing Lorraine and her lover in her home anyway.
Charles is the owner of Cinelli Sanitation - the Lupertazzi crime family's waste management front where John Sacramoni works. He was involved in a dispute over Barone Sanitation following the death of Dick Barone in 2006 which ended with his buying the company. While going over the payroll he finds discrepancies with consultant Tony Soprano, Paulie Gualtieri and Johnny Sack, but is told to mind his own business by a savvy employee who is in the know. He attended Allegra Sacrimoni's wedding.
"Coco" is, likely, a soldier in the Lupertazzi crime family. He owns/manages a small restaurant named Joey's, where he also works as a waiter. "Coco" is often seen accompanying Butch DeConcini. He and Butchie beat up a construction foreman when he informs them their no-show jobs were pulled by Tony Soprano after his dispute with Phil Leotardo. While inebriated from drinking Sambuca, he makes aggressively lewd remarks to Meadow Soprano while she is on a date with Patrick Parisi (son of Patsy Parisi) in NYC. Shortly after Meadow tells Tony of the incident but brushes it off as public intoxication, Tony Soprano severely pistol-whips and curb-stomps him in his restaurant, knocking his teeth out and reportedly almost killing him.
Salvatore "Coco" Cogliano.
Butchie says that "Coco" is an okay guy which suggests that he has good standing in the Lupertazzi crime family, but Tony suggests that, possibly, he is a borderline alcoholic. His name could have been taken from former Lucchese crime family underboss and acting boss, Ettore ("Eddie") Coco, who served under Carmine Tramunti.
Raymond "Ray-Ray" D'Abaldo is a soldier in the Lupertazzi crime family, who used to sell stolen items out of the back of his Ford Crown Victoria in his early criminal career. He attends a meeting at Flatbush Bikini Waxing and is one of the assassins contracted out for hits on the Soprano family. He expresses surprise and disdain that Bobby Baccalieri is No. 3 in the Soprano family, finding it comical. He is involved in the assassination attempt on Silvio Dante but runs out of bullets before he can gun down Patsy Parisi and is seen by the patrons of the Bada Bing that come out and see the shooting. Ray-Ray is last seen in "Made in America," walking outside with Butch as he talks on the phone with Phil.
Dominic is a member of the Lupertazzi crime family. He attends Phil Leotardo's welcome home party after Phil's recovery from his heart attack and later attends a hostile sit down between Tony and Phil. In the episode "The Blue Comet," Dominic also participated in the meeting at the Flatbush bikini waxing store when Phil's underboss Butch DeConcini and consigliere Albie Cianflone informed everyone who exactly was to be killed when Leotardo decided to "decapitate" the Soprano crime family and do business with what was left.
Partner of Lorraine Calluzzo, a loan shark in New York associated with the Lupertazzi family. During the infighting following boss Carmine Lupertazzi's death, Lorraine kicked up to Little Carmine. Jason is Lorraine's loan collector and, although muscular, he does not demonstrate shows of strength, either when Lorraine is intimidated by Phil Leotardo and warned to start paying Johnny Sack or when Lorraine insults him. When intimidating Lorraine for the first time, Phil implies that Jason is a homosexual and remarks that he probably taught her how to give oral sex. When Lorraine does not comply with Phil's orders, Phil returns with Billy Leotardo and Joe Peeps. Jason is killed off-screen, as Lorraine tries to escape, she is killed by Billy "You were told to kick up to John" not far from where she discovers Jason's dead body. It is unknown whether Joey Peeps or Billy Leotardo killed Jason.
An overweight member of the Lupertazzi crime family under Phil Leotardo, Gamiello joined Leotardo in reacting with scorn when hearing of Johnny Sack's decision to take a plea bargain and break omerta. Gamiello joined with Gerry Torciano in murdering Vito in a hotel in Fort Lee, New Jersey because of Vito's homosexuality, while Leotardo watched. He commented to Phil Leotardo that Vito was "a disgrace" to organized crime. Later, Dom visited Satriale's to deliver money to Silvio Dante and Carlo Gervasi. Dominic is a close friend of Silvio's and asked him for gambling advice. Although Fat Dom starts passive-aggressively insulting Vito and crudely implies that Gervasi is homosexual, Silvio silenced him with a blow to the back of the head with a dustbuster. Silvio told Carlo to just "hit him" but Carlo repeatedly and fatally stabbed Dominic in the stomach with a butcher knife. Dominic's murder infuriated Tony Soprano and Silvio and Carlo closed Satriale's under the cover story that a water pipe had burst, while they cleaned up and disposed of the body. Carlo and Silvio first planned to dismember his body but finally decided to bury it at a construction site and ditch the car somewhere along the side of a highway. Carlo was seen disposing of Dom's severed head (which he was keeping in a freezer at his house on the Jersey Shore) at the beginning of the next episode, by shoving it down a storm drain in Connecticut. Dom's murder was assumed as payback for Vito Spatafore's killing by the Lupertazzi mobsters, even though Tony denied any knowledge of his disappearance to them at the families' truce meeting. Dom's only daughter lived in a motel in Metuchen, New Jersey and he had planned to visit on the day of his murder. Dominic had the Beethoven composition "Für Elise" as a ringtone on his phone.
Consigliere to Carmine Lupertazzi for 30 years before his incarceration at United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth. Angelo was imprisoned on charges relating to a construction project in Yonkers. During his prison time, he became close friends with Tony Blundetto. He was released alongside Blundetto as part of the "Class of 2004." He has a son named Charles who is into architectural salvage and is a fan of Jackie Gleason and "The Honeymooners".
Angelo Garepe.
Infighting occurred amongst the members of the Lupertazzi crime family following Carmine's death. Angelo chose Little Carmine's side along with capo Rusty Millio. Even though Angelo claimed to be "retired," he remained an important figure, and was suggested by Tony Soprano as part of a power sharing triumvirate to end the infighting. (Tony's proposal was that Johnny Sack, Little Carmine, and Angelo would all be equally in charge, but no major decisions could be made without a majority vote.) Angelo reluctantly went along with the idea. Interestingly though, Tony told Johnny Sack that the power sharing idea was Angelo's—this was intentional on Tony's part in order to allow him to maintain some distance from the conflict and appear merely as a neutral go-between, rather than a mediator (Tony had mentioned to Christopher Moltisanti that the instability between John and Little Carmine was serious.) Johnny Sack angrily dismissed this power sharing idea.
During the infighting, Angelo recruited his old friend, Tony Blundetto, to murder Joseph "Joey Peeps" Peparelli—an associate of Johnny Sack and member of Phil Leotardo's crew. Following this, Phil and his brother, Billy Leotardo, killed Angelo.
Angelo's murder had two major repercussions—it caused Little Carmine to withdraw from the fight, as he couldn't stomach any more bloodshed, making Johnny Sack the undisputed successor to Carmine, Sr. It also provoked Tony Blundetto to pursue the Leotardos, shooting and killing Billy Leotardo while wounding Phil. This nearly started a war between the New York and New Jersey crews, and anger from this conflict remained until "The Sopranos"' conclusion.
Ginny Sacrimoni's brother and Johnny Sack's brother-in-law. Infante is an optometrist, but also serves as a reluctant back-channel through which Tony Soprano and Johnny Sack communicate while Johnny is in federal detention. Although the business and etiquette of the mob was alien to him, with coded discussion proving a particular difficulty, Infante made an effort to assist Johnny in salvaging what was left of his command.
Anthony Infante.
When Johnny agreed to asset seizures to lessen his sentence, he had Anthony reach out to Tony to arrange the sale of a share of a company that he was an unofficial partner in. The owners were in New Orleans and, after a difficult first meeting, Tony was not optimistic. Anthony realized the importance of the deal to his sister and family and arranged a more favorable share for Tony to ensure that it would go through.
Anthony was often teased by Tony and his crew in his role as a go-between; they stole sunglasses from his shop and played with him when he brought a gift for Tony and not Sil to a meeting. He also had some difficulty communicating in code with Johnny.
He is last seen in "Stage 5 (The Sopranos)" telling Johnny about Johnny's diminished street credibility, and assuring him that Johnny will be remembered for being a good father and a good husband, which seems to be enough for John in the end.
Associate of the Leotardo crew. Takes part in the beat down on Hesh's son-in-law. Later attends the meeting with Tony, Hesh, Phil Leotardo and Gerry Torciano to make restitution for Hesh's son-in-law's injuries. Later seen guarding Phil's hospital bed after Phil's massive heart attack. He also attends the party celebrating Phil's return to being boss of the Lupertazzi family.
William "Billy" Leotardo was a soldier in Phil Leotardo's crew and Phil's younger brother and dim-witted partner in crime who is on friendly terms with Tony Blundetto. Billy killed Lorraine Calluzzo and Jason Evanina with his friend Joe Peeps. He sells computer printer toner cartridges out of the back of a truck that he has ordered for the Esplanade construction site offices. Following Carmine Lupertazzi's death, a power struggle between Johnny Sack and Little Carmine ensued. One side was led by Carmine's underboss, Johnny Sack, while the other was ostensibly led by Carmine's son and Miami capo, "Little Carmine" Lupertazzi, although it is likely that consigliere Angelo Garepe and capo Rusty Millio were the real power behind this faction. Joe was killed soon after and Billy took part in the response - a hit on Angelo Garepe. Finally, Billy himself was killed by Tony Blundetto in revenge for the death of his friend Angelo, causing lasting distress to his brother Phil, who was wounded in the attack, and held his brother in his arms as he died on the street.
Associate/soldier in Phil Leotardo's crew. Jason accompanies Phil on his hunt for Tony Blundetto after Phil's neck injury. He participates in Phil's beating of Benny Fazio with a cane in Long Branch, New Jersey outside The Crazy Horse Too in the club's parking lot. The beating leaves Benny Fazio in a coma and Phil's subsequent intimidation of Joanne Moltisanti and pretends to be a friend of Moltisanti from Alcoholics Anonymous. He shows restraint when Phil threatens to hurt Joanne in saying that Phil should lay off, saying it's going to far to threaten family members. In the episode "Johnny Cakes" Sil tells Tony that Jason thought he saw Vito in Tampa, Florida when Jason was visiting his mother but was mistaken while both families are searching for Vito.
Rusty is a capo in the Lupertazzi crime family, married to Gianna Millio. Rusty is a close associate of Little Carmine and considered to be one of the instigators in Little Carmine's power play following boss Carmine Lupertazzi Sr.'s death. After Lupertazzi's death, Rusty turns down the position as head of the Lupertazzi crime family but later regrets his decision. He helps Angelo Garepe orchestrate the hit on Joe Peeps (with Tony Blundetto as the hitman) after telling Little Carmine "We'll steamroll right over John, and I predict the guys in the streets in Brooklyn and Queens will welcome us as fuckin' heroes! It'll be easy..." He offers Tony Blundetto the contract on Joey Peeps which Tony hesitantly turns down having not made up his mind on his future.
Rusty Millio.
Since the truce and Johnny Sack's arrest, Rusty refuses to be in the same room as, or take orders from, acting boss Phil Leotardo. Johnny Sack orders a hit on Rusty (whom he referred to as "The Mayor of Munchkinland," due to his short stature standing at 5'5") through Tony, because he feels Rusty is likely to wrest power away from him while he is in prison. In the episode "Luxury Lounge," Rusty and his bodyguard/driver, Edward "Eddie" Pietro are assassinated in Rusty's driveway by Italian hitmen contracted by Tony. In the episode, Rusty's address is said to be 134 Deweunter Terrace in Brooklyn.
Rusty is portrayed by singer Frankie Valli, who is also referred to in his own right in the series. In the season 1 episode "46 Long," Tony brings his mother, Livia, some flowers which were brought from the "same florist that Frankie Valli uses when he comes to Jersey." Christopher Moltisanti also classes Valli as one of the great Italian-American singers. There is also a scam of selling stolen Frankie Valli concert tickets with Tony Soprano. In the episode "Christopher" a Native American Chief invites Tony and some friends to his casino so that he may ask Tony to get Frankie to come to his casino for a week, a job that Tony delegates to Silvio, who mentions that he hasn't talked to Frankie for years.
A soldier or associate in Rusty Millio's crew. Acted as a driver for Rusty in "All Happy Families..." A 'mook', as the term is used in the film "Mean Streets", is a derogatory title given to someone who is a degenerate gambler and overall "scumbag." The character is given no other name.
"Muzzy" Nardo (first name unknown) is a pimp working for Phil Leotardo's crew. He operated a brothel that Joey Peeps collected from. It is his brothel that Joey Peeps is murdered outside along with one of his prostitutes as they are leaving to go to 42nd Street in Manhattan by Tony Blundetto. His brothel is improving in business and was increasing its profits since the previous month suggesting that the brothel had not been open that long. He pays a share of his earnings from the brothel to Joe. He is seen complaining to one of his prostitutes that they were spending too much time socializing with their customers and not having sex. He lets his prostitute leave with Joe Peeps for an evening out on the town after he shows an interest in her. He has a similar last name to Cleveland mobster Giovanni Narchionne, who went by the last name "Nardi." It is never clarified if Muzzy witnessed the shooting and was the witness that was able to describe the "hobbling gunman" later implicated to be Blundetto.
An associate/soldier in Phil Leotardo’s crew. He accompanied Phil Leotardo and Jason Masucci on the hunt for Tony Blundetto. He was with Phil when he beat down Benny Fazio and rode to up to Pat Blundetto’s farm to discover Tony B.’s corpse. It is unknown as to what David’s status is in the New York Family. He has not appeared again in the series.
Joseph "Joey Peeps" Peparelli born in New York City in 1964 is an associate in Phil Leotardo's crew and an aide-de-camp to Johnny Sack. He was an avid player of golf and usually played with Johnny. Joey is drinking alongside Johnny Sack at Benito One, a bar on Mulberry Street in Little Italy, Manhattan when he thought Donny K is laughing at him - this is during his beef with Ralph and his crew over an insult to Ginny Sack. He tells Johnny Sack that he is dating a stage performer and former ballet dancer that performed in the "Cats (musical)", once coming home and seeing her in her stage costume. Joey is unable to restrain John from following Donny outside, beating and urinating on him but Joey quickly spirits John away from the scene once he is finished. After this Joey contacts the Asian hitman that Johnny ordered to kill Ralph Cifaretto, and subsequently tells the hitman to call off the murder when Johnny decides against it agreeing to pay him extra for his troubles. He is not married and lives with his mother who is confined to a wheelchair and Sacrimoni takes care of her financially following his murder. Paulie Gualtieri makes a comment suggesting that Joey was not intelligent. Joey often goes to high-level sit-downs with Johnny Sack and enjoyed playing golf with him. During the infighting amongst the Lupertazzi crime family Joey and Billy Leotardo kill lady shylock Lorraine Calluzzo, and her partner Jason Evanina, for kicking up to Little Carmine instead of Johnny Sack. As a method of retaliation, Joey is killed along with the prostitute from the brothel by Tony Blundetto when leaving a Manhattan brothel that he collects protection money from. It is shown that he is a frequent habituate of the brothel and picks up a prostitute, Heather, to take downtown. He drives a Lincoln Town Car. When ordering his death, Angelo Garepe refers to him as "a friend of a friend, not a friend of ours," assuring Blundetto that Peparelli is not a made man. At Peparelli's funeral, Tony Soprano is aghast that his crew accidentally has a formal headstone carved with the name "Peeps," instead of his proper surname "Peparelli."
Friend of Johnny Sack's who became his consigliere once Johnny took over as boss of the family. However, it is revealed in "All Due Respect" that Petrille had been a turncoat cooperating with the FBI and gave up information going back to Sacrimoni's criminal activities in 1981, which was instrumental in Johnny's arrest.
Edward "Eddie" Pietro was a soldier in Rusty Millio's crew and his right-hand man. He often accompanied Rusty and acted as his driver on such occasions as Raymond Curto's funeral and Allegra Sacrimoni's wedding. When seeing the supposed "Italian tourists", Italo and Salvatore he is angered at being stopped and asked for directions, mocking their limited knowledge of the English language. Eddie was shot in the head multiple times alongside Rusty while backing out of Rusty's driveway while late for a meeting with Phil Leotardo and to pick up groceries. He chauffeurs Rusty around in a Mercedes Benz S430.
Aging Mustache Pete mobster with a full head of white combed back hair who is friendly with Phil Leotardo and his wife. He is a veteran made man of the Lupertazzi crime family. Tony Soprano calls Faustino "senile" due to his age. He had the enmity of the rest of the family for his actions while Phil Leotardo was recovering from his heart attack. Just before the death of Johnny Sack, the official boss of the family, Santoro ordered a hit on Gerry Torciano. Torciano was the perceived successor to Phil Leotardo. Doc had him brazenly murdered while he ate dinner with Silvio Dante. During a sit-down over a union dispute with contracting firm DiLeo Construction in an Italian restaurant, Doc humiliates Phil by taking food from his plate, even as Phil acknowledges Doc as the new head of the family. Phil avenges his long-felt humiliations and has Doc murdered, along with his bodyguard, outside a massage parlour and brothel in Chinatown, Manhattan, cementing his own claim to be the boss. One of the gunmen shoots out Santoro's right eye. Butch DeConcini is one of the getaway drivers. Tony Soprano and the crew learn of Santoro's murder from watching a televised news report at the Bada Bing. He is consequently the shortest serving boss of any family in the series.
Anthony is an associate/soldier of the Lupertazzi crime family. He accompanies Joe Peeps when he beats up the Soprano family's scam artist Polish-American home appraiser, V.I. Trifunovitch, over their dispute about profits from the HUD scam.
Gerardo "Gerry" Torciano, was a protégé of Phil Leotardo, also known as "the Hairdo," due to his coiffed hair. Torciano appeared to handle the street business of Phil Leotardo's old crew, as acting capo, during Phil's accession to acting boss. Torciano and Jimmy Lauria got into an altercation with Hesh Rabkin and his son-in-law Eli over extortion money collections being done on the crew's territory in Brooklyn. Torciano's men burned them out of his car, beat up Eli, and slugged Rabkin. As Eli fled he was hit by a taxi cab in a hit and run and hospitalized. Later, Torciano apologized to Tony, claiming that he thought Eli was a civilian, and made restitution for his injuries. Torciano attended Allegra Sacrimoni's wedding and listened to Phil's discussion of Johnny Sack's apparent weakness when he was dragged away in tears. He sometimes used ill-placed metaphors when discussing mob business that frustrated and confused mob associates, who jokingly referred to him as Walt Whitman.
Gerardo "Gerry" Torciano.
He was made official captain in 2006. A celebratory dinner was held for him at Nuovo Vesuvio attended by members of the Soprano and Lupertazzi crime families. Torciano accompanied Leotardo on his visit to New Jersey for the Feast of St. Elzear and later accompanied Leotardo to a meeting about the new Tidelands construction project. Dominick "Fat Dom" Gamiello and Torciano murdered Vito Spatafore in his motel room while Leotardo watched. In 2007, Gerry died at the hands of a hitman (on orders from Faustino "Doc" Santoro) in a New York City restaurant while dining with Soprano family consigliere Silvio Dante and their respective dates.
Torciano had blonde hair but later in 2006 changed the color to black.
