Plot.
Flashbacks.
Jack Shephard and his father, Christian, discuss the effectiveness of surgery on an Italian man, Angelo Busoni, with a spinal tumor. Christian advises against the surgery. However, the man's daughter, Gabriela, tells Christian, "We didn't come for you." She and her father had read about the miraculous recovery of Jack's wife, and they hope that Jack can work another miracle. Jack agrees to operate, despite his father's disapproval. After one long night, Jack returns home to his wife, Sarah, who tells him that she has taken a pregnancy test after being late for her period; the test is negative. Later, when Gabriela is in Jack's office, signing release forms, Jack warns her of the risks of surgery, but she ultimately decides to proceed. Christian abruptly walks in on them as they share a quiet moment. When Gabriela leaves, Christian warns Jack about the dangers of getting too close to his patients. The surgery is not successful and Angelo dies on the operating table due to heart failure. Jack tells his father that he will break the news to Gabriela. Christian replies that he has already told the woman and she has left the hospital. Jack finds Gabriela in the parking lot, crying over her father's death. He tries to console her, and the two end up kissing. Jack pulls away and leaves, telling Gabriela that "[he] can't". At home, Jack confesses to his wife that he kissed another woman, but promises that he will change. As he holds her, Sarah pulls away and tells Jack that she has met someone else and she is leaving him. Her things are already packed. "You will always need something to fix", she says before she leaves.
On the Island.
On the island, Jack discovers Locke, who is unconscious in the hatch's gun cache. Soon after, Michael enters with rifle drawn and pointed at Jack, announcing that he is going into the jungle to retrieve his son, Walt, who has been taken by the Others. Jack tries to reason with him, and volunteers to assist Michael in his task. However, Michael refuses to listen, telling Jack that he must go alone. Jack asks Michael if he would really shoot him, to which Michael replies, "No, but I'll shoot that computer." Michael adds that the computer is "not what you think it is." Jack backs down, and Michael leaves after locking Jack and Locke in the gun closet.
After being freed by Kate and Sawyer, who show up to get Sawyer's bandages changed, Jack intends to go after Michael. Locke and Sawyer volunteer to accompany him, but Jack refuses Kate's request to come as well, explaining that she must stay and take care of the button.
During the search for Michael, Locke reveals that he is aware of Sawyer's real name, James Ford, since Hurley had given him the passenger manifest. Locke asks Sawyer why he chose that name, but Sawyer refuses to answer. At that moment, gunshots are heard. Jack, Sawyer, and Locke continue hiking towards the source of the shots. They find shell casings from Michael's gun.
That night, while Jack and Locke argue about whether to turn back or keep searching, they are met by the bearded boat captain who kidnapped Walt in "Exodus". The man calls them by name and apparently knows personal details about them. He tells them Walt is fine and that Michael will not find him. The man adds, "This is not your island, this is our island, and the only reason you're living on it is because we let you live on it", and scolds them for "opening doors that they shouldn't be opening". He tells them to leave their weapons and go back, and that the Others will then leave them in peace. Jack refuses, believing the man is bluffing and that there aren't that many "Others". The man calls out to his unseen companions, and a dozen torches suddenly ignite, surrounding Jack and his fellow castaways. The bearded man then calls for "Alex" to "bring her out". A bound-and-gagged Kate is brought forth, and the man puts a gun to her neck. It is revealed that Kate was captured as she secretly trailed Jack, Sawyer, and Locke. Faced with a difficult decision, Jack relents, and lays his weapons down. Locke and Sawyer follow. Kate is let go and Sawyer removes her gag from her mouth and unties her and the Others leave, threatening to return if the castaways "cross the line." Sawyer tells the bearded man that the business between them isn't over.
In the bunker, Hurley and Charlie go through the LP record collection, finding one by a group named Geronimo Jackson. Hurley then asks Charlie what chances he has with Libby, though Charlie is preoccupied thinking about Claire. On the beach, Jin and Sun talk and confess to each other that neither wants to be told what to do.
Upon returning to camp, Jack refuses to hear Kate's apology. Sawyer consoles her, saying he would have done the same thing if Jack had told him to stay behind. At the end of the episode, Jack speaks to Ana Lucia on the beach. He questions her about her past as a police officer and asks "How long would it take to train an army?".
Reception.
19.13 million viewers watched the episode's first United States airing. The LA Times liked the Jack flashback and "that cool moment when the Others light their torches", but disliked the progress of the story and the cliffhanger that went nowhere.
