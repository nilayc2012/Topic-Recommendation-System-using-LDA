Plot.
Sixteen-year-old Keisuke Saji loves to fantasize about young beautiful women. He hopes to land the object of his affection, Koizumi Akira. Koizumi is a classic tsundere, switching between violence towards Saji and affection. While most guys take Koizumi's cold shoulder as a hint, Saji pursues head-on without having rejection faze him.
The plot of the anime covers the early portions of the manga it is based on (the manga currently being at over 30 volumes long in Japan). There are, however, a number of alterations. Most obvious is the removal of Saji and Koizumi's sex life. Their first night together is implied rather than explicit, and other times they were intimate instead end with Saji being kicked or punched into space.
Additionally, for the sake of time most likely, many side plots of the manga are ignored, an example being the exclusion of Arigase's boyfriend, a shy young man named Konoe, and the tale of how they met.
Lastly, several events in the story occur in a different order in the anime than they do in the manga.
