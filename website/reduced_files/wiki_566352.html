 <p>Sir Aglovale (or Agloval) de Galis is the eldest legitimate son of King Pellinore in the Arthurian legend. Like his brothers Sir Tor, Sir Lamorak, Sir Dornar and Sir Percival, he is a Knight of the Round Table. In romance, Aglovale never cuts as impressive a figure as his brothers Lamorak and Percival, but his valor is unquestioned. According to the Post Vulgate cycle and Malory's "Le Morte d'Arthur", it is he who first brings Percival to Camelot to be knighted. In the Vulgate Cycle, Aglovale dies accidentally at Gawain's hand during the Quest for the Holy Grail, but in Malory he and his brother Tor are among the knights charged with defending the execution of Guinevere. They are killed when Lancelot and his men rescue the queen.
Aglovale appears prominently in the Dutch romance "Morien". In a situation similar to Gahmuret's begetting of Feirefiz in Wolfram's "Parzival", Aglovale visits Moorish lands where he meets a beautiful black Christian princess and conceives a child with her. He returns to his own lands, and thirteen years later, his son Morien comes to find him. After a number of adventures, father and son are reunited and both return to Morien's country to take back their rightful lands. In modern times Aglovale starred in his own novel, "The Life of Sir Aglovale de Galis" by Clemence Housman, and T.H. White's "The Once and Future King" gives a particularly endearing portrait of the knight.
