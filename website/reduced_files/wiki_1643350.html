<h1>List of Shameless characters</h1>
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=12891024'>Wikipedia Link</a>
 <p>The following is a list of fictional characters from the British comedy-drama Shameless, created by Paul Abbott, which began broadcasting on Channel 4 in 2004. The programme is set on the fictional Chatsworth Estate in suburban Manchester, and the surrounding area and primarily follows the lives of the Gallagher family and the neighbouring Maguire family, and their friends and neighbours in the town's shops and local pub the Jockey.
The first series focuses on layabout Frank Gallagher and the lives of his six children, Fiona and boyfriend Steve, Lip, Ian, Carl, Debbie and Liam, and next door neighbours, Kev and Veronica.
When the second series begins, the Maguire family are introduced, with certain episodes just focusing on their family, and both the Maguire family and Gallagher coming into contact and conflict, with marriage, teenage pregnancies and neighbourhood rivalry.
Other characters also take major focus throughout the years after only starting off as minor characters, such as the Karib family. Since the series started, the Gallagher family has split hugely, with many of the Gallagher children departing the show, due to the actors moving onto other projects.
Vernon Francis "Frank" Gallagher (born 26 January 1960) is the main protagonist of "Shameless".
The Gallagher family.
Frank Gallagher.
Frank's hallmarks are drunken rants on a wide variety of literary, historical and philosophical subjects, usually returning to how decent, hard-working people, among whom he erroneously seems to count himself, are discriminated against. Frank frequently quotes Shakespeare, the Bible, references international current events and uses poetry and soliloquy to express his feelings or view, as he does at the start of each episode. Thus, in spite of his drunken ramblings, sometimes he does come across as being well-educated owing to the issues he raises during his interactions with others.
Frank is an unemployed alcoholic, and the son of Neville and Sarah Elizabeth Gallagher (1935–1972). He was married to Monica, with whom he has six children (Fiona, Phillip, Carl, Debbie, Liam, Stella), and one, Ian, to whom he is de jure father. He also has two children with Sheila Jackson, Nigel and Delia, and is the father of Monica's half-sister, whom he fathered with Monica's mother at Monica's birthday party. He has two grandchildren, Lip's daughter Katie and an unnamed child of Fiona's. During one of Frank's drunken rants, it is implied that he got many girls pregnant in school. Although this is never elaborated upon, it is unclear precisely how many children Frank has actually fathered.
Frank was apparently convicted and sentenced to imprisonment several times in his youth. He claimed to have been incarcerated in Strangeways Prison. It has not been mentioned what exactly were the reasons for his string of past convictions.
Frank's alcoholism intensified after his first wife Monica left him for Norma Starkey. He then left the younger children in the care of Fiona, and moved in with agoraphobic Sheila Jackson. Often known to make a fool out of himself and shirk all responsibility, Frank nonetheless shows signs of loving his children. He can offer good advice, for example saving Liam from being taken into care when a parent was needed. When he is rendered completely sober by a new drug, Frank appears reflective and even quite intelligent, wondering why Sheila would add to her problems by marrying a mess like him. We also understand his character a bit better when Frank's father pays a visit and treats his son in a condescending and abrasive manner. Frank's father shows extreme sympathy towards Sheila and even takes care of the twins. It is also stated that his father did not always treat Frank kindly when Frank was growing up.
In early series Frank comes across as a drunken bully, even headbutting his son Ian on one occasion. Most of his children initially hate Frank for his drunken bullying ways. Lip and Ian are never scared to show their feelings towards him, and even physically attack him on a few occasions. However, his middle daughter Debbie shows sympathy throughout the series when her father is either in serious trouble or presumed dead, something which has happened three times to date. The family have generally warmed towards him more as the series has progressed, mostly because he isn't bothering them hugely on a daily basis. However, Debbie finally grew sick of taking care of the family, and cleaning up after Frank in particular, and left to join the army after series 6. Frank and Liam came into serious conflict in series 7, when Liam was forced by circumstances to take over Debbie's former burden as the de facto head of the family. At one point, Frank headbutted Liam, and a furious Carl had to be restrained from beating Frank to a pulp. Frank finally softened towards Liam when Liam threatened to commit suicide.
In series 7, Frank falls for a librarian named Libby Croker. Libby believes Frank is a man of the arts and he encourages her to rise up against her library closing, which leads to a violent protest and her imprisonment. When Libby is released from prison, she tries to find him, but her upscale appearance causes various characters to warn Frank that the DSS is after him. Finally, they meet again, and although Libby is initially put off by his poor character and the frosty reception from Liam, she and her mother move into the Gallagher home. Frank and her mother soon set up a mutual loathing society, with Frank painting her bedroom a bright yellow just to keep her awake. In Series 8 Frank is kept hostage in a psychiatric hospital by former wife Monica's girlfriend, part of Monica's plan to snatch her family back from Libby Croker and prevent the pair from getting married. On Frank's escape, the pair stay unmarried and he eventually loses Libby in Episode 13 after cheating on her with Letitia's head teacher.
In series 8, Frank is ready to get married to Libby Croker and he goes missing on his stag night. Libby starts putting up posters because of his disappearance. Chesney Karib and Carl Gallagher find a video on the internet; it is Frank having sex in public. Libby walks in and sees the video. In the feature length 100th episode Frank is accused of beating an old lady who is well known on the estate for her scratch-card winnings. Frank suffers a blackout and throughout the episode has flashbacks of that evening. Not knowing if he actually carried out the attack he hands himself into the police. His son, Carl Gallagher is convinced Frank is innocent. He digs into the events of that night and finds that a local gangster's brother had actually carried out the attack. Frank, along with Kev devise a plan to work with the police and cut a deal with the gangster that sees Frank set free.
From Series 9, Frank is the only original member of the Gallagher family left after Carl leaves to join the police. He now wears a darker version of his fond parka and occasionally slips on a pair of glasses when reading.
Monica Gallagher (born 24 April 1963) is Frank's estranged wife, and the mother of Fiona, Phillip, Ian, Carl, Debbie, Liam and Stella. She is bisexual and left Frank for a lorry driver named Norma. She came home at the end of series 1 but had left by the start of series 2, she then returned for good at the beginning of series 4 and resumed co-habiting with Frank. Although her intentions for this were unknown at first, a visit from her mother in series 5 explained her backstory and a possible reason of why she returned to be with her children. Monica announced at the beginning of series 5 that she was pregnant again, giving birth to Stella at the end of the series. She has two known grandchildren, an unnamed child from Fiona when she left in Series 2, and Lip's daughter, Katie.
Monica Gallagher.
When she returned home in series 1 and series 3, her children, apart from Carl, treated her with nothing but suspicion and hostility for leaving them with Frank. Fiona (in series 1) and Debbie (in series 4–6) were especially hostile since they were the ones who were forced to take on the household duties. Even when Monica returned for an extended stay, Debbie was still the one to look after Liam and to an extent, her older brothers. Although Monica wanted to be a good mother, and was shown doing some household chores, laziness and selfishness prevented her from being any real help.
In series 6, feeling unloved by her children and Frank, Monica left once again. However, Monica returned in series 8, after the family receives news that her daughter, Debbie, has been killed. She acted the same way with Frank's new partner, Libby, as she earlier did with Sheila. It soon became apparent that the death was a hoax set up by Monica and her civil partner, a psychiatric nurse called Milly, who dresses up as an army officer and tells Libby that Debbie was killed in Afghanistan. Monica looked set to claim back her family, even going as far as to demand custody of her youngest children and, when Frank and Libby were reunited, Monica admitted that the reason she returned was truly for Frank as he was the one and she would "always come back". However, Frank knew that she would leave again, the same as she did before to him and to Norma and wouldn't let her ruin another of his relationships, so chose to stay with Libby. It was then revealed that Liam (who started warming up to her before leaving in series 6) had decided to live with Monica permanently so he could help her to see love inside herself. She returns in the show's penultimate episode when she sees on the news Frank and Stella are held hostage and tries to negotiate a deal where would take Stella's place, but ends up locked with her daughter and ex-husband. Soon, Monica and Frank admit to still having feelings and they have sex. In the final episode, she gives birth to her eighth child but feels guilty about aborting his twin brother and drowns in her own guilty and neglects her child, and the returning Fiona is disgusted to know that Monica is still the same person that abandoned her. Monica eventually shows concern and stands up to Frank when she realizes Fiona is taking her two kids with her.
Sheila Jackson (previously Sheila Gallagher; born 1962) is the third married second wife of Frank Gallagher. She is the mother of Karen Maguire, who she had with second husband, Eddie Jackson and twins Nigel and Delia Gallagher, who she had with Frank in 2005.
Sheila Jackson.
Sheila was first married to Sheldon. Sheila murdered Sheldon and buried him in her back garden after years of domestic abuse. Her second husband and father of Karen, Eddie, left her in series 1 after he caught his daughter performing oral sex on Ian and Lip Gallagher under the dining room table.
Sheila suffers from agoraphobia and is a fan of daytime television, especially "Countdown", finding it unbelievable that someone doesn't know who Carol Vorderman or Richard Whiteley are. She has a fixation with performing anal sexual acts upon Frank. She named her twins after two famous chefs, Delia Smith and Nigel Slater (although it is possible that the latter was named after Nigella Lawson). Sheila left with the twins to go on a cruise after discovering Frank had not divorced his former wife Monica, who had suddenly reappeared with her lesbian girlfriend.
In the last episode of series 5, Frank goes into a coma and dreams of his unusual family, where Monica still has her physical body, but the mental state of Sheila, In which Frank refers to her as Sheila-Monica. This is shown in the way that she dressed and the sound of her voice while holding up a sign of Sheila's face. This may indicate that Frank still has feelings for Sheila, despite their previous marriage being illegal as Frank never got a divorce from Monica before they were to wed.
Fiona McBride (née Gallagher; born 24 February 1983) is the eldest child of Frank and Monica Gallagher. She was the acting mother to her five siblings after her mother left due to Frank's lack of responsibility. She is also the best friend of Veronica Fisher. During the early episodes, Fiona had a part-time job as a teaching assistant at a local nursery.
Fiona McBride.
During her childhood, she used to be referred to by the other kids at school as "Pov Gallagher" due to her family's low income and her parents' perpetual unemployment. Fiona also once claimed to be proud that she was the only girl in her year-group during secondary school not to fall pregnant before taking her GCSEs.
After her boyfriend Steve McBride got caught up in a botched drug bust, he had to leave the Chatsworth Estate. Fiona was reluctant to leave with him, as she did not want to abandon her siblings and friends. During his absence, she briefly hooked up with Craig Garland, and became pregnant with his child. But she still retained feelings for Steve, and when he returned briefly, he told Fiona that her siblings were more than capable of looking after themselves without her, and that she deserved a better life outside of Chatsworth. With the support of her family and friends, Fiona left with Steve at the end of series 2 and now resides in Amsterdam. In series 8, Libby Croker mentioned that Fiona was married.
In the final episode of the show, Fiona is called back to Chatsworth by her mother Monica after hearing she has lost a baby. However, she is enraged to discover her mother attempted to abort twins, leaving one–Ben–alive. She is disgusted to find Monica and Frank are neglecting Ben and choosing to let Fiona's six-year-old sister Stella to take care of him. Reminded of her own past as sole parental guidance for her other siblings, as well as overhearing Lip talk about the mistreatment her younger siblings will receive once Monica gets over the aborted child, Fiona plots to snatch Stella and Ben to free them of the lifestyle she and her younger siblings went through. She leaves the kids with Kev Ball so that she can contact Steve. However, Stella runs away. When she is found by Frank, he stops Fiona's plans and she still isn't convinced to leave the kids with her parents after Lip and Carl plead her not go through but does become convinced when she realizes Frank can't abandon his children and this gives Fiona a new found respect for her father. After the family reconcile, they party with the other Chatsworth residents in the Jockey.
Steven "Steve" McBride (born 1979) is Fiona Gallagher's boyfriend. He was first seen in a club, watching Fiona dance with her friend Veronica Fisher. When a mugger stole Fiona's bag, Steve gave chase and attempted to catch him. Although he failed, Fiona still took him home. Once back at their house, he admitted (while undoing his trousers) that he had noticed her a month before, and that if she wanted him to stop, he would. She did not, and they went on to have sex. Steve later bought Fiona a washing machine to woo her, and they got together, after Steve revealed he stole cars for a living. In the middle of the second series he was forced to flee the Chatsworth Estate after he was involved in a murder at a drugs deal he was involved in. However, he later returned for Fiona in the emotional finale of series two. He now resides in Amsterdam with Fiona. He has a daughter named Kerry-Anne from a relationship in his youth.
Steve McBride.
Steve is from a family of doctors, referring to them as "the medical equivalent of a battery farm". Steve himself had also previously studied to become a doctor before leaving med school after two years.
Steve is often presented as the moral hero of the show. Although a car thief, he proudly claims to have not committed a single violent crime in his life. Similarly, he dislikes the way Frank treats his kids. When Fiona's father Frank struck his son Ian, Steve got him drunk and took him to Calais in France in the boot of his car.
Phillip "Lip" Gallagher (born 9 January 1988) is the oldest son and second child of Frank and Monica Gallagher. His parents delayed his birth registration for over a year. This is revealed to Lip on his 18th (actually 19th) birthday in series 4. According to his father, his nickname was bestowed upon him owing to him being "a bit of a gobshite." Lip is in a long-term, open relationship with Mandy Maguire.
Lip Gallagher.
When still in high school, Lip would charge money from other students so he would do their homework assignments and SAT test for them.
During series 1 he was in a relationship with schoolmate Karen Jackson, who dumps him for his own father Frank, causing him to batter Frank in the middle of the street in a rage. He is ballsy, charismatic and never afraid to stand up to anyone, including the feared Maguire family. Lip dates a string of girls throughout the show, even partaking in a romantic affair with Lena, a woman considerably older than he was.
Lip is close to younger brother Ian and was the first person to find out about his brother's homosexuality. Lip keeps it a secret and eventually becomes completely accepting of it. In series 3 Mandy gives birth to Katie (who she named after Mimi) but does want to involve Lip with the baby as she believes he will walk out on them. That same night Lip takes his blame on Frank and accidentally insults Debbie in the process.
He is highly intelligent, takes 10 GCSEs, and eventually accepts an offer from Nottingham University in the last episode of Series 4. In the first episode of series five he returns to the estate during his university break to see Mandy and Katie. His secret girlfriend from university, Alex, decides to make a trip to the Chatsworth Estate. This costs Lip his relationship with Mandy after getting into a bar fight as well as realizing Lip is embarrassed of his daughter and ends up kicking him out of the Gallagher home. 
In the tenth episode of series 7, Mimi Maguire takes Katie to Brighton to visit Lip. It is revealed that he has finished university, acquired a new job in London where he is now working as an architect, and would have been engaged to be married to Mandy. Mimi decides that it is best to leave Katie in the care of her father. 
It is later revealed Mandy and he got married and Mandy was pregnant. 
Jody Latham confirmed on Twitter that he would return to the show in the season 11 finale. It was also said that he lived in the area but never visited because he did not want daughter Katie living near or knowing Frank and the Chatsworth Estate.
Ian Gallagher (born 11 August 1989) is the third oldest Gallagher sibling and is aged 15 at the beginning of the first series in 2004. He is the son of Monica and Gary Bennett, revealed when his blood group was found to be incompatible with the rest of his siblings'. His half-brothers are Phillip Gallagher, Carl Gallagher, Liam Gallagher, Sean Bennett and 3 unnamed sons of Gary Bennett, and his half-sisters are Fiona Gallagher, Debbie Gallagher, and Stella Gallagher. He has one niece, Katie Maguire. He used to work at The Jockey as a barman but in more recent series his employment, if he has any, has not been shown.
Ian Gallagher.
In the early series, Ian is depicted as closest to his brother Phillip, with whom he shares a room, and is initially the only member of his family to know that he was gay. The brothers often have to look out for each other more than any of the other characters, due to being party to each other's secrets. In later series, all the family, except Frank, are aware of his sexuality.
Ian often identifies as gay, having various relationships with older men throughout the first four or five series. Kash Karib was his only long-term boyfriend, though he has a brief relationship with Sean Bennett, and an ongoing friendship, sometimes sexual, with Mickey Maguire. Because he is unaware of his parentage at the time, Ian also unknowingly sleeps with his half-brother. Ian sees Sean Bennett at their biological father's funeral and later tells the truth to Sean, who wants to keep seeing Ian, but eventually agrees that they can not ignore their familial relationship. Beginning in the fourth series, Ian has a number of relationships with women. He repeatedly has sex with a girl he is briefly hiding in his home for her protection, but when she asks him to leave with her, he declines, knowing a relationship would not work. He has a relationship of convenience with Mandy Maguire, to protect his secret, which nearly turns sexual when they're both at a low point, but they fumble about until Ian decides it's a bad idea. In the seventh series, Ian begins a serious relationship with Maxine Donnelly. When Maxine's brother Bruce asks if their being in a relationship means Ian is now "bisexual", Ian pauses, before saying he just believes he has found the right person.
Due to Gerard Kearns break to work on a film, Ian leaves in the first episode of the 6th series after suffering amnesia. He is seen in episode two in a clip of him partying abroad and appears on webcam in later episodes. He returns in the seventh episode; this features the debut of Danny, a deaf teenager whom Ian unwittingly transports back to the UK in the boot of his car. Ian now lives in the house of Danny's deceased grandfather, which was leased to him by Danny's Aunt Pegg, in gratitude for looking after him. Danny and Pegg later move to Spain he later lets Mickey move in with him.
In Series 7, it appears Ian has remained at Danny's old address and has accepted Mickey Maguire as a tenant. Ian supports Carl's girlfriend Maxine when she decides to have an abortion and break up with Carl. Maxine moves in with Mickey and Ian. The situation becomes complicated when Maxine asks Ian to pose as her boyfriend to impress her parents. Ian and Maxine begin to develop feelings for each other and have sex. Mickey sees them and tries to convince Ian he shouldn't be with a woman, but Ian says the labels don't matter, he wants to be with Maxine. This leads to a major falling out with Mickey, who feels betrayed. Mickey tells Carl, who then beats up Ian in the toilets at The Jockey. In spite of the remaining tensions, Ian and Maxine become a couple.
Even with the lingering animosity from Carl and Mickey, Ian and Maxine are happy but they are thrown into turmoil when Carl (along with Chesney) runs away after being accused of murder. Ian is initially not bothered with Carl's absence, and is more concerned at just how concerned Maxine is over Carl. When Ian and Maxine are in The Jockey, Maxine confronts Jimmy, whom everyone knows is the killer. As Ian looks on, Jimmy's sister hits Maxine in the head with a pool cue. Ian feels ashamed that he let Maxine fight the battle on her own and in spite of her reassurances, he begins to believe that she would have been better off with Carl. To try to prove his worth, Ian attempts to tape a confession from Jimmy, but Jimmy sees through his plan and savagely beats him. Ian begins to further withdraw and is unable to have sex with Maxine; during the time they do spend together, he becomes more paranoid about her feelings every time she mentions Carl. Carl's name is soon cleared and he attempts to make amends with Ian, but Ian isn't interested. He again accuses Maxine of wanting to be with Carl, to which she tells Ian she just doesn't want to be with him. In spite of this conflict, Ian and Maxine still have strong feelings for each other, and Carl convinces Maxine that she and Ian belong together. Ian shows up at hospital soon after Carl and Maxine talk, and he and Maxine smile at each other, and they reconcile.
In the finale of series 7, Ian and Maxine were returning home after a night out, when they are accosted by a ruffian who attempts to mug them. But they fight back and overpower the thug, and drag him back unconscious to their house. The thug turns out to be a hireling of Roscoe, a Moss Side-based crime lord. After hours of deciding what to do with him, Maxine overhears a conversation where Ian admits that he would "rather fuck him than kill him". This seems to be the end of the relationship, as Ian's sexuality may might turn out to be the source of future infidelities. When Ian prepares himself to kill the thug, Maxine and he find that he escaped from his bonds while they were conversing. Ian is seen later with a backpack, apparently leaving Chatsworth. It is not stated whether it is because he is leaving Maxine or if it is to avoid retribution by Roscoe's gang. He happens upon Karen, as she and Joe are about to leave Chatsworth themselves. After witnessing Joe's abusive treatment of Karen, Ian stows away in the boot of Joe's car. After Joe tries to beat and abuse Karen, Ian kills him and makes his exit from the show to dispose of the body.
In a later episode in series 8, Carl is shown to get a 'Happy Birthday' text from Ian. In the final episode of the show, Lip mentions that Ian is engaged to a transsexual.
Deborah "Debbie" Gallagher (born 27 January 1993) is the fifth Gallagher sibling. She is Frank and Monica's second eldest daughter. Phillip, Carl and Liam are her brothers. Her sisters are Fiona and Stella; her half-brothers are Ian and Nigel; and her half-sister is Delia. Although Debbie is only 16 (at the time of her last appearance on the show in 2009), she is old beyond her years because she grew up without a mother and undertook the majority of the domestic tasks. Since Fiona went to Amsterdam, Debbie is often tasked with saving the family from ruin. For example, she steps in when Liam denounces God and the school he attends makes a move to expel him. Although the results are disastrous, she shows herself to be a diligent individual upon whom her family can depend. Originally Debbie was presented as a slightly unusual and awkward child, she retains her high intelligence and resourcefulness throughout the show. This allows Debbie to be successful when she becomes head of the household and takes care of the domestic duties such as cooking, ironing, cleaning and taking Liam to school. She also provides her family members with a high level of emotional support. As a consequence, Debbie missed out on socialising and has become mature beyond her years. When Fiona left Chatsworth at the end of series 2, Debbie seemed, at first, to relish the responsibility of running Gallagher household.
Debbie Gallagher.
In series one, Debbie abducts a three-year-old boy because she "wanted a girl, but none of the girls on the estate would take the chocolate". So she dressed him up in girls clothes. The child's disappearance caused the majority of the estate to go up in arms in search for young "Jody". When Debbie finally admits her actions to her family, a furious and bewildered Fiona, Steve, Lip, and Ian, formulate a plan to return the youngster back to his family without incriminating Debbie. After circulating false rumours of sightings around the Chatsworth Estate for much of the day, Debbie emerges as the hero of the hour when she returns the boy to his distressed family.
Debbie's closest familial relationship is with her father, Frank. Unlike Fiona, Lip, Ian and Carl, Debbie admires him and often shows her love for him, often seen to be the most affected when he is in danger or trouble. For example, she screams in terror when she believes that Frank's body has been found in a nearby canal. Throughout the series, Frank often lets Debbie down and seems to be unappreciative of her efforts to keep the family together. For example, during some of his drunken rants, he presents himself as being lumbered with children whom he has the sole responsibility of caring for them and seems to forget occasionally what an asset Debbie is to the family. Debbie's feelings of closeness to Frank often leave her the most vulnerable to being let down by him. Debbie's loyalty to her father is occasionally rewarded, and it is strongly suggested that Frank appreciates 'Little Debbie' more than anyone else in the world, though that changes when he tells her crush Luke that she sleeps around the estate in hopes she doesn't sacrifice money for charity, and even when Frank tries to do good and give her money for a trip she still refuses to forgive him. Debbie also detests her mother more than the rest of the family, refusing to forgive her for abandoning them years ago or for her continued laziness and self-absorption. She did respond sympathetically when more details became clear regarding Monica's abusive childhood at her mother's hands. In contrast, Debbie was close to Frank's ex-wife Sheila.
Debbie's relationship with the rest of her family is generally good. She views her siblings as her dependants and generally supports them through their various misadventures. The rest of her family generally recognises all she does for them. She's particularly protective of and very close to her younger brother Liam. Her relationship with him seems to border between surrogate-parent and partner-in-crime, as she has frequently enlisted Liam's help with some of her past schemes. These include faking Liam's kidnapping when Frank wouldn't admit that he hadn't won the lottery, and she once entered him in a modelling competition, which she wanted to keep a secret from Monica. She can also be seen to forge strong relationships with other characters, notably Marty Fisher and Mandy Maguire, she also tends to come up with numerous money-making schemes to provide income.
It is revealed in Series 5 that Debbie has been in a secret relationship with police officer Tom O'Leary, despite the fact that she is only 15 years old. Debbie and Tom break up at the beginning of series 6 during her 16th birthday party when she realises that Tom is too old for her and that he wants much more from the relationship. Tom begins to stalk her, although he tells workmate Carrie that Debbie has been stalking him.
Debbie is now seemingly in a relationship with a man called Mark, whom she met on a night out with Maxine and when she got drunk, he took her back to his student residence to sleep, but nothing more. Debbie left the students room the next morning, thinking that she'd never see him again. However, at a funeral the family had been invited to, they met again, and she discovered it was his Grandmothers funeral.
At first, Debbie was a little objective to a relationship with him after he made comments about Frank (who had decided to go to the toilet behind a tree at the funeral and then punched Mark) however she told Maxine of her feelings for him. He later appeared outside Debbie's home and when she refused to see him, he sat on a chair in the middle of the road until she did. He later used the chair when a hired gunman was going to kill both Paddy and Mimi, but Mark knocked the hit-man out with the chair.
After this, Debbie and Mark have sex in on the kitchen floor, reminiscent to the scene in the first episode where Steve and Fiona also have sex in the kitchen, in the same place as Debbie does. Debbie does not return in 2010 for series 7. We find out from Frank's grandmother, who comes to visit, that Debbie has joined the army. At seventeen, Debbie perhaps had no wish to allow her role as the driving force of the Gallagher household hold her back from her potential. Liam, who had been virtually brought up by Debbie since the age of four, has taken on her former role in the Gallagher household or maybe after Child Services incident she realized she was unfit to being a parent figure to her dysfunctional family and joined the Army to find her place.
In episode 11 of series 7, Debbie sends the family a letter telling them she's being sent to Afghanistan. In Episode 1 of Series 8 an army SNCO visits the Gallagher household and reveals that Debbie has been killed in action. This subsequently turned out to be a malicious joke by Frank's ex-wife Monica.
Carl Gallagher (born 18 January 1990) is a fictional character from the Channel 4 drama Shameless, he is the fourth oldest Gallagher sibling. The son of Frank and Monica, his brothers are Phillip and Liam; his sisters are Fiona, Debbie, and Stella; his half-brothers are Ian and Nigel; and his half-sister is Delia. Initially he played only a minor role in the show, but since series two has been featured just as much as the other Gallagher children.
Carl Gallagher.
In the first series, Carl was jointly played by Tittensor's twin brother Luke Tittensor, but since the second series he has played the role alone.
In series 3, Carl briefly worked for the Maguires by growing marijuana for them in his loft, until the police found out about the production. Carl was briefly taken into custody, and gave a statement that the marijuana was grown for the household's own personal use. But after a tip was given to the police about Mandy Maguire selling weed, her mother Mimi suspected that Carl betrayed them and sent her sons Donny and Shane after him. Later, Carl's siblings Lip, Ian and Debbie, figured out that the only person with the motive for informing the police about Mandy's dealings was in fact her brother Shane, who was angry that his mother chose his sister over him to oversee that area of the family business. After Lip confronted Shane over the matter, Shane agreed to call off the family hunt for Carl.
Carl develops a long tally of sexual conquests in the later series, one notable example being the mother of one girl whom he was dating during his last year of secondary school.
In series 6, Carl realises Mickey Maguire is gay; he is one of the few people on the estate, along with Maxine, his brother Liam and his half-brother Ian, who is aware of this. Micky makes several unsuccessful passes at Carl.
Through series 6 and early series 7, Carl pursues and begins a relationship with auxiliary nurse Maxine Donnelly. Carl breaks up with Maxine after she admits to having aborted his child and feeling he is too immature to be a father. Carl soon decides he wants another chance with Maxine, and is encouraged when she has sex with him in the Jockey toilets. However, he does not know that Maxine only had sex with him to get her mind off Ian, whom she is beginning to have feelings for. Carl proposes to Maxine, but she turns him down. Carl continues to hope until Mickey, out of hurt and jealousy, tells Carl about Maxine and Ian. A heartbroken and enraged Carl meets Ian in The Jockey toilets before savagely beating him. He smashes the engagement ring to pieces and cuts all ties to Maxine and Ian.
Carl begins working for Michelle, the head of a male escort agency that Jamie Maguire briefly worked for; when Jamie no longer wants to have sex with her, an eager Carl is more than capable of taking over the job. Unfortunately this proves to be the one bright spot for Carl around this time. He and Chesney go to a party and afterwards are in the street with a boy named Bonehead, who shows them a video he took of a girl he'd taken advantage of. Her brother, Jimmy, a local tough, viciously attacks Bonehead in front of them, and threatens them into staying silent. When Bonehead dies, Jimmy makes sure they are seen as the prime suspects, and threatens them into fleeing town. Carl and Ches end up on a farm in Wales, but when Carl is able to get reception for his mobile phone, the messages of support from Maxine and his family move him and he and Ches decide to return home. They hide in Chesney's shop but when Jimmy again threatens Carl's family, Carl attacks him. Carl even gets a gun to use on Jimmy, but Joe Pritchard convinces him this would be a mistake. Ultimately, Joe makes Jimmy disappear, Jimmy's sister clears Carl and Ches, and the Maguires convince Jimmy's gang to leave the Gallaghers and Ches alone.
Carl and Ian still have bad blood, with blood literally spilled for Ian as his attempt to tape a confession from Jimmy had ended in a beating. Ian did not accept Carl's apologies for what had happened over Maxine and he drives Maxine away by accusing her of still wanting to be with Carl. Carl visits Maxine at hospital and tells her he knows she was right to have the abortion. He convinces her to give Ian another chance, as he says that he can be her mate, but Ian is her soulmate. Ian and Maxine reconcile, and so do Carl and Ian.
As of series 8, Carl is the only original Gallagher child left, after Liam decided to stay with his mum, and Carl seems to have feelings for best mate Chesney's cousin Sita. He also had sexual relations with her. He proposes to Sita, but she turns him down. He isn't good enough for her. Carl also seems to fancy soon-to-be step-mum Libby, when he starts to get visibly aroused when he looks at her backside and legs. In series 9, Carl becomes a police officer and leaves Chatsworth to move in with his girlfriend, Clem, thus leaving none of the Gallagher children on the estate.
Liam Gallagher (born 26 January 1999) is the second youngest of the Gallagher children and is a minor character until series 5, when he takes a more central role in the main storylines. He apparently suffered from epileptic fits when he was smaller, although this has never been seen. It was also implied that he used to wet the bed, though he claims that it was only to help put out the fires, which he had a fondness for starting, as seen during his pyromania phase in series 4-5 (matchboxes and lighter-fluid were routinely found under his mattress by Carl and Ian). Throughout the series, Liam is practically raised by his older sisters, Fiona and Debbie, as Frank is lazy and Monica inept- when she is around. In later episodes, Liam shows considerable intelligence and resourcefulness like sister Debbie and is also an outspoken atheist. In series 5, signs of genius in Liam became obvious when he was shown to be an adept car thief, much like Steve McBride, and was seen later to use a defibrillator on a comatose Frank when it was thought that his heart had stopped. In series 6, it is revealed that Liam is a talented musician, and also fluent in Sign Language. Given his academic performance, the school determines Liam to be an exceptionally gifted pupil, which leads to him being awarded a special scholarship. During an interview at a local university, he initially fails to make a good impression due to nervousness. But that changed when his father Frank attempts to steal the "Joy of Sex" manual from the university library; Liam plucks up the courage to tell the panel of education directors why he deserves the scholarship in an impassioned speech.
Liam Gallagher.
Liam was also persuaded by his brother Carl to create false identities on the internet for him, Chesney Karib, Maxine Donnelly, and Micky Maguire, so they would be admitted into an exclusive nightclub.
In series 3, the then five-year-old Liam was almost expelled from his RC primary school when he openly denounced religion during a Christmas nativity play that was held by the school. Debbie learned of this development on New Year's Day 2006 when meeting with Liam's headteacher and a local parish priest. Debbie tried to warn Frank of the situation and the expected visit from the school, but to no avail. On the day of the school visit, and when it was apparent that Frank was not going to help, Debbie had to take matters into her own hands. She shaved Liam's head, and told the school administrators that her little brother had Cancer. Unfortunately, the rumour got out of hand, and spread out across the Chatsworth community, until a fundraiser for "Liam Day" was set up by Jez Dawson, the landlady of "The Jockey".
While apparently an atheist, it was hinted in series 6 that Liam may have had change of perception on the matter, even when he expertly refuted the arguments of two Jehovah's Witnesses, whom Monica tricked into baby-sitting Liam and Stella, he stated that "they may not know it, but they're right and I'm wrong". He also tried to get rid of the clothes Debbie and Maxine stole, thinking that they brought "bad Karma". In series 7, Liam quoted from passages in the Old and New Testaments that condoned prostitution when Kelly thought that her occupation would disqualify her as godmother of Karen and Jamie's son. And was seen later with a copy of the Torah when counselling a Jewish convert with a penchant for pork-scratchings. Although knowledgeable about religion, Liam does not appear to endorse nor practice any of them.
Liam is now one of the few people in Chatsworth who is aware of Micky Maguire's homosexuality. He sarcastically tells Micky that he figured it out through his "amazing powers of deduction", despite Micky's stereotypically gay mannerisms and aesthetic preferences.
In series 7, Debbie has left Chatsworth to join the army, and perhaps due to this, Liam seems to have taken on more responsibility within the household, even getting a job delivering newspapers to support the family. His relationship with Frank has soured to the point that Liam has grown openly contemptuous of his father as he starts to develop more of Debbie's traits, (such as shouting at and attacking Frank & Carl for their antics). Liam now attends a prestigious senior school.
He soon falls for a girl called Holly, whom he meets during his music lessons. Holly takes Liam home to meet her parents, when he tells them his father is a deceased heart specialist. But an accident at school exposes the lie. Despite this, Holly wanted to continue the relationship, but her comments against Frank hurt Liam's feelings, and cause him to leave with Frank.
After the Gallagher household falls behind on their HP payments, Liam gambles at Joe's shop to raise cash. Despite showing great aptitude early on, Liam ends up losing to Joe's bluff during a game of poker, owing him £100. Unable to come up with the money, Liam desperately asks his drunk father for help. Frank accidentally headbutts him, causing Liam to run out of The Jockey. Later on in the episode, Liam contacts Joe, asking "if I die, would it clear my debt?" Joe hurriedly seeks out Frank, Carl and Ian, who find Liam on top of a building threatening to jump. When a scuffle ensures between his brothers and father, he moves to a different ledge, and throws his phone down. After a heartfelt pledge by Frank to be more supportive, and from Joe to write-off his debt to him, Liam seemingly jumps, but he simply lands onto the balcony 7 feet down, recovers his mobile phone, and holds both Joe and Frank to their promises.
When Carl is framed for the death of a local boy, Liam is instrumental in helping to clear his name and convincing him to come home.
Liam struggles to adjust to Frank's new girlfriend Libby Croker taking over the mother role in the household. Liam begins to act more hostile towards her than ever. Liam feels that Frank is taking advantage of Libby, as he did with Sheila. The family realise why when Carl finds a letter Liam has kept from Debbie which tells them she has been sent to Afghanistan. Liam does a school report on a World War II veteran, Reggie. Slowly they become friends and Liam tries to help Reggie as he has no one to take care of him since being widowed. Carl, Kelly, and Libby all feel suspicious of their friendship, especially when Libby sees Liam wearing a dress (Liam wore one of Debbie's dresses as it reminded him of her smell). Liam defends Reggie, but when Reggie, knowing that he was close to death, desperately hugs him and doesn't want to let go. Liam completely mis-interprets Reggie's reasons, and flees the house. However, Liam begins to realise he was wrong about Reggie and returns to apologise and sit with Reggie as he dies.
Liam skillfully plays an acoustic guitar during The Jockey's talent night in episode 12. By then, he seems to have eventually warmed to Libby Croker after she promised him that she would never leave no matter how much Frank might put her off. In various episodes, Liam is seen to adopt Debbie's mannerisms and views in respect of his feelings about religion, figures of authority and the ways in which his family cope with one another. Debbie was Liam's main care-giver and role model since Fiona's departure from Chatsworth in series 2, being the main nurturing influence in his life from the ages of four to ten. Debbie and Liam had such a strong bond with each other, that she would frequently use his help in various activities. It was to Liam whom she addressed the letter to when she was assigned to Afghanistan.
Between Series 7-8, Liam was the remaining Gallagher on the Chatsworth estate that possesses any sense of responsibility and maturity. In series 8, when the family received the news of Debbie's death in Afghanistan, Liam was willing to travel on his own to personally break the news to Fiona. But there was no need, as the news turned out to be a cruel hoax by the returning Monica. When Monica came back, Liam finally confronted his mother on her attitude toward her family. Monica replied that her relationship with his father was "above right or wrong". When Monica left after her deception was revealed, Liam followed her to the bus stop, where her latest Lesbian lover greeted her. Liam realized this was the same person whom earlier dressed as an army NCO to falsely inform them of Debbie's death. Liam attends Frank's stagnight to keep him out of trouble, but the other drunken revellers playfully tie Frank up and leave him in a cemetery, while taking Liam to a brothel and leaving him with a prostitute. Libby is furious when she finds out, but Liam assures her that he didn't have sex. He only paid the girl for her time with him, and won the money back in a game of Three Card Brag. When Frank goes missing after his stag night, Monica demands custody of Liam and Stella. When she came to collect them, Liam forced Monica to take him rather than Stella, otherwise he would make her life difficult. Liam left with Monica after saying he would come back as soon as Monica gets her new house from the council, which was the true reason she wanted Liam and Stella in the first place. In the fifth episode, just before Frank and Libby's wedding, Carl reads a best man's speech written by Liam, which turns out to be a personal message from him. Liam says that he's decided to stay with Monica, saying that she's had a hard life and that he wants to help her love herself, much to the sadness of everyone in attendance. Liam had left the Chatsworth Estate to live with Monica. Although, by Series 11, Monica came to live with Frank, without Liam, indicating that Liam left his mother sometime after the events in Series 8. In the final episode of Shameless, Liam was stated by Lip to be a practicing Buddhist.
Stella Gallagher is the youngest daughter of Frank and Monica Gallagher. She has appeared in a recurring role since May 2008, and appeared on a regular basis in the eleventh and final series.

Nin Gallagher.
Played by: Edna Doré (Series 7)
Nin Gallagher is Frank Gallagher's grandmother who appears in the first episode of series 7 of "Shameless". She apparently brought Frank up and rescued him from a life of misery at the hands of her son Neville, Frank's father. She is somewhat resentful of Frank, calling him a "selfish little shit". She is close to all of his children, especially her great-grandson Liam. She is the carer for her husband Bunty, who does nothing but eat. Out of desperation, she shoots Bunty dead in front of Frank and willingly goes to prison for it. She is last seen when she is visited by her grandsons Liam and Ian Gallagher, and she appears to be loving prison life. In her final scene, she deliberately causes a prison riot to extend her sentence as she wants to spend the rest of her life in prison.
Patrick Donal "Paddy" Maguire (born 20 April 1964) is the patriarch and the head of the Maguire family, the most feared and therefore most respected of the local criminal families. His cherished wife is Mimi, and he has an identical twin brother called Noel, who is gay. It was shown in Series 6 that he is a supporter of Celtic F.C. and in the background at the Maguire residence there is a statue of a Celtic player, who looks similar to the old Celtic captain, Bobby Lennox.
The Maguire family.
Paddy Maguire.
Patrick is extremely aggressive and violent and his presence puts fear into most people on the Chatsworth Estate. For example, when he and his family enter the local pub, The Jockey, the customers sitting at the table beside the entrance clear the seat for them. He and his family are also drug dealers on the Chatsworth estate. He has a particular dislike for the Gallagher family, particularly Frank and Lip, which he has demonstrated on several occasions, both physically and verbally. However, in more recent series, Paddy has begun to show a more compassionate side, and since series four, he has also become much more accepting of Lip Gallagher, as well as Karen Jackson, the wife of his oldest son Jamie. Paddy's identical twin brother Noel was credited as being played by Neil Grades, an anagram of actor Sean Gilder. Paddy also has a strong sense of family and is loyal toward them. For example, when his daughter-in-law Karen becomes severely depressed he becomes the rock upon which she can lean.
Despite his initial dislike of Frank Gallagher, this mindset was then turned after Paddy choked on a cashew nut in The Jockey and Frank performed the Heimlich manoeuvre, thus saving Paddy's life. Frank also saved Paddy's life again, stopping him from injecting himself with what would have been a lethal dose of heroin. Paddy now has some grudging respect for the Gallaghers.
Despite showing open contempt for higher education, Paddy has occasionally shown knowledge of certain literary subjects.
In Series 6, Paddy was briefly abducted by the mother of a teenager who died after using his drugs, who in revenge repeatedly injected Paddy with heroin, causing him to become addicted to the substance. His attempts to conceal his new habit and deal with its effect on his life were a recurring theme of Series 6, with him finally going cold turkey later in the series, during which he had visions of his father Padraig. In addition to the visions of his father, Paddy fantasizes about sleeping with Karen and Kelly, who are both his daughters-in-law.
In series 7, Paddy's marriage to Mimi is near enough over, due to the fact that his affair with Maureen results in the tragic circumstances of the series 6 finale, in which daughter Mandy is murdered in an explosion. Separated, living in separate houses and each given the freedom to see other people, Paddy takes a night out with sons Shane, Micky and Jamie as an opportunity to restart his love life with a meaningless one-night stand with a female clubber. When he can't "pull", he returns home, alone and defeated, and is greeted by Kelly. After a short conversation, Paddy hands Kelly an amount of money, in exchange for sex. Kelly accepts this money, and they have sex in the living room, while Kelly's boyfriend and Paddy's son Shane look all over the nightclub for him. Later on in the episode, an awkward Paddy and Kelly exchange moments, in which Paddy offers Shane and Kelly the master bedroom of the Maguire house, out of guilt. Some time later, Kelly rejected Shane's marriage proposal, as she could not marry him after lying to him. Shane insisted he would forgive her anything, no matter whom she had slept with, but the guilty looks between Paddy and Kelly made him realise what had happened between them. Paddy was so ashamed of his actions that he was willing to inject himself with heroin at Shane's request, but Shane stopped him at the last minute. Paddy then attended Shane's and Kelly's wedding.
Paddy starts a relationship with a dance enthusiast named D'reen, and makes plan to emigrate to Cuba with her. When he realised that he couldn't leave his family and business, Paddy put a spotter on his plans, and shared one last dance with D'reen before she left.
Paddy begins applying heavy pressure on Jock, the owner of the boxing club, who had borrowed heavily from the Maguires. Meanwhile, he relentlessly belittles Micky when Micky wants to join the fire brigade. Micky's self-confidence falls through the floor and he berates Paddy for always putting him down. Paddy's belligerence towards Jock leads Jock to set himself and the club on fire. Micky risks his life to save Jock. When Jock is in hospital, Paddy reveals that he had been a young boxer at the club; he had real potential to use his skills to get a better life, but Jock essentially sold him to a crime family. Micky reveals to Paddy that he lied about passing his fire test. Paddy tells Micky it doesn't matter, Micky is still more of a man than he will ever be.
On 6 March 2010, it was announced that Sean Gilder had quit "Shameless" after five years with the show because of his rumoured dislike of Tina Malone who portrays Mimi. He departed "Shameless" at the end of Series 7, Episode 14.
After Paddy's departure, Mimi gives birth to her eighth child. It is unclear whether or not Paddy has died. Frank utters the words, at one point in the show: "I never thought I would say this, but bring back Paddy Maguire!" Although, in the same episode, Joe implied to Karen that Paddy was killed after returning to Ireland. In episode 14 of series 8 a coffin is carried through the estate, supposedly with Paddy inside, but it turns out this was Paddy's way of smuggling guns to the rest of the Maguires. Jamie tells Kelly that Paddy's plan was to make the police think he was dead, so he could start again, and that he is now living in Thailand.
Katherine Harmonica Joy Catherine "Mimi" Tutton (née Murphy, previously Maguire; born 4 October 1963) is a fictional character from the Channel 4 drama "Shameless"., Mimi is the brash, foul-mouthed, and violent matriarch of the Maguire family. She is the wife of Paddy Maguire, mother of Mandy Maguire and Cilla Tutton and the Maguire boys, Jamie, Shane, Mickey, the late Fergal and the little seen Joey and Donny, and the daughter of "Nana" Murphy. Her ex-boyfriend is also named Paddy. She is also a drug dealer on the Chatsworth Estate and is frequently seen doing so on the show. She is extremely violent, easily angered and arguably more intimidating than her Husband, Paddy; though as the series progresses she becomes less hotheaded. She has headbutted several characters on the show including Lip Gallagher, Sue Garland, Cassie Western and even her own son Shane and strike fear into the likes of Frank, Lip, Ian, Carl, Debbie, Carol, Karen, her kids and even Paddy. Mimi is as hard as nails, and she can hold her own with men and women. At one point during Series 3 a whole riot squad is needed to restrain her after she attempts to free her daughter Mandy from incarceration at the police station.
Mimi Tutton.
In series 5 a more sensitive side to Mimi is shown after her ex-boyfriend, Paddy, makes a crass comment about her weight. She describes herself as a "bulimic who can't stand vomit". In the same series, she is shown attending anger management classes. In Series 6, Mimi experiences some regret over her lack of education when son Micky takes film classes. Mimi does most of his coursework for him, and when he decides the class isn't for him, he allows Mimi to take his place.
Mimi is presented as a character who behaves in ways which are polar opposites. For example, she has no qualms about selling drugs to children and behaving in a violent manner. However, she also has strong maternal instincts and shows compassion for others. For example, when Chesney reacts badly after consuming drugs, she and Paddy care for Chesney by feeding him and ensuring that he sobers up safely. Later, when Yvonne accuses Mimi of being an intolerant racist, Mimi retorts by describing the racism that Paddy faced when he arrived in England from Ireland. Yvonne and Mimi realize that they share love for their own children and would do anything to ensure their happiness. Also, Mimi is someone upon whom Libby can depend when she seeks advice or assistance.
The Maguire family's drug dealing business comes back to haunt them when Mimi's beloved Paddy is abducted and forcibly addicted to heroin by the bereaved mother of one of their deceased customers. To make matters worse, she is arrested for an assault that her son Jamie carried out. However, she freely states that she wants to take the blame for the attack, claiming "A mam's gotta do what a mam's gotta do". This is because she does not want to see her ex-con son go to jail again. At the end of series 6, her beloved daughter Mandy is killed by the woman who got Paddy addicted to heroin. The strain of this loss causes Paddy and Mimi to split up.
In series 7 Mimi lives in The Jockey as landlord and has an affair with a friend of her son Mickey, until she finds out that he is only fourteen years old (although he looks just as old as Mickey). After the boy starts to blackmail Mimi into a secret relationship, Mimi tries to threaten him to keep him away from her, finally giving him a gun filled with blanks and daring him to shoot her. When he pulls the trigger, she pretends to be dead, and he flees Chatsworth, believing he has killed her.
Mimi attempts to join a local women's group to find companionship and feel better about herself, but they rebuff her attempts to appear in their risque charity calendar, making her feel fat, unattractive, and worthless. To add insult to injury, they ask Mimi to supply them with some party drugs to help loosen them up before the photo shoot. In revenge, Mimi gives them such potent 'treats' that they begin cavorting around in their underwear, groping each other. Mimi films them and sets up a website to display the shots.
Mimi gives birth to a newborn daughter at the end of series 7 after complaining of stomach pains and nausea which scared her into believing she had started menopause. The baby was presumably fathered by estranged husband Paddy. According to the Shameless website, Mimi will return to living in the Maguire house, with baby daughter Cilla, in series 8. It is implied that she is unsure who fathered Cilla because of her fling with underage Billy. It is later revealed that Cilla's father is in fact Billy, who returns to Chatsworth to be part of the child's life. At the end of series 8 the couple marry, despite ongoing controversy and disapproval of much of the family. In series 9 Mimi forces Billy to have an open relationship because she is worried she is to old for him. It is also implied she knew her son Mickey was gay all along, after she encourages him to leave the estate with a baby he has saved, which he does.
James Patrick "Jamie" Maguire is a fictional character from Channel 4 drama "Shameless", he is the oldest son of the notorious Maguire family, the son of Paddy and Mimi Maguire, and recently returned after serving a ten-year prison sentence for manslaughter. Much to his parents' disgust, he appeared to be reformed, rejected his family, got a job as a barman at "The Jockey", began training as a probation officer, and became engaged to his Jockey co-worker, Karen Jackson. Jamie has a tendency to sleepwalk on occasion.
Jamie Maguire.
In the last episode of series 4, Jamie revealed that he had admitted his guilt in order to get parole so that he could hunt down his father's three former cellmates, who were planning to muscle in on Paddy's territory and dispose of him. His new reformed life was a sham to cover his murders of these three men. Karen assumed that his courtship of her was part of this pretence, but Jamie claimed that he really loved her and they were married at the end of the episode.
During series 5, Jamie does his best to avoid joining the family business. He and Karen take over The Jockey, and things go smoothly until Karen miscarries early in series 6. She distances herself from him, questioning if she would want to have a child that would grow up in the Maguire family. Eventually, the two separate after Karen refuses put a "Maguire" on the pub's license with her. It is during this time that Karen begins sleeping with Joe, able to break it off with her increasingly controlling lover only after she threatens to lie to the Maguires and tell them he continued to physically abuse Mandy, Jamie's sister. Jamie moves home with Karen, and she soon finds out she's pregnant again, not sure if the father was Jamie or Joe.
Despite being portrayed as one of the warmer of the Maguire family, Jamie has become somewhat of a dark and aggressive character, possibly due to him taking on the family business while his father was going cold turkey when recovering from drug addiction. Jamie is shown to go to extreme lengths to get revenge, sending one such message to Joe Pritchard (after finding out about Karen's affair with him) by digging up his recently deceased father and leaving him slumped outside of the local shop. He also proves that unlike his two brothers, he is a very effective debt collector and head of the family business, having no qualms about threatening or injuring if it brings results.
Jamie becomes a father in series 7, but afterward witnesses the gradual mental breakdown of his wife Karen, unaware that the overwhelming guilt and self-loathing she carries is eating away at her inside. After Karen's release from hospital, they fall behind on household bills, and Jamie is finding it difficult to cope with his wife's mental illness. He meets a woman named Michelle while on a night out, and has sex with her in the ladies toilets. Michelle runs a male escort agency, and leaves her card in Jamie's pocket, along with some money. They meet later when Michelle offers Jamie a job. Despite his obvious disgust at the thought of working as a "man-whore", Jamie agrees to the offer. He services Michelle and other women, needing the money as well as some time away from Karen. When Karen begins to suspect an affair, Michelle confesses her love for him, and Paddy uncovers what he's doing and tries to tell him to stop, Jamie finally has enough. Initially Michelle is reluctant to let him go, but when he introduces her to the virile young Carl Gallagher, she changes her mind.
During this time, Karen has continued her destructive affair with Joe Pritchard, who seemed to have no concerns about her illness or her erratic behavior. Eventually, Joe announces to Jamie that he's having an affair with his wife, and claims that he is baby Connor's father. As his marriage implodes, Jamie is also trying to deal with a threat to both the family and their business, since his father has left Chatsworth for Ireland.
As series 8 begins, Jamie is in counseling with Karen who has returned with their son. He beats up a cab driver, erroneously believing the man is Joe, and Karen finally admits Joe is dead, although she does not tell him he was murdered while attempting to kill her. She and Connor move back with Jamie into The Jockey as they attempt to make their marriage work. In the meantime, Jamie tricks his brother, Shane, into willingly giving up his attempt to run the family business. When Shane finally realizes Jamie manipulated him into giving up leading the family business and killing a loan shark, he tells his wife, Kelly, that Jamie was born for this, "Scammin', schemin' and killin'." Then Jamie finally accepts Karen back into their marital bed, telling her that he "could tape his stiffy to his belly" after watching her all day. In series 8, Jamie is shown to be scared of clowns since he saw one of them choke to death when he was young. This led to his discomfort with Karen's new business as a party clown, which lasted only until a customer attempted to molest her. Luckily, one of the guns Jamie was selling ended up in her bag, and she was able to shoot the customer and get away, leading to Jamie taking the gun back and soothing her in a hot shower.
After losing to Karen in a card game, he agrees to put the pub back in her name, and the couple are seen looking up at the new sign, showing "Jamie and Karen Maguire" as the proprietors of the Jockey.
In series 9 Jamie acts a spokesman for the estate when the majority of the people who live there are evicted. He later cheats on Karen with Gloria. He and afew others become trapped underground after a family job goes wrong, they are eventually saved and it is unclear if his and Gloria's affair will continue.
Shane Maguire (born 10 August 1983) is a fictional character from the Channel 4 drama "Shameless". He is part of the Chatsworth estate Maguire gangster family, the brother of Mickey (whom he constantly squabbles with), Donny, Joey, and Jamie, as well as the late Fergal and Mandy, and son of Paddy and Mimi.
Shane Maguire.
Shane is known for his short and unpredictable temper and limited intelligence, although he was once shown to possess great instincts for shopper's habits during series 5 when he briefly worked in Yvonne Kharib's Cash and Carry off-licence shop. Judging by certain scenes from series 3-4, the other Maguire boys, except for Jamie, seemed to be taking direction from Shane, in the absence of Paddy and Mimi, which might imply that Shane is the second oldest of the Maguire children. In series 6 Shane suffers a head injury whilst running a hotel scam with his lover, Kelly. After coming out of a coma, Shane is left partially paralysed and bed-ridden. Conflict arises between Kelly and Shane's overpowering mother, Mimi, over who will oversee his convalescence. However, with physiotherapy and speech therapy, his condition begins to improve.
After a running a series of wedding scams together, Shane asks Kelly-Marie to marry him, but she was hestitant to do so. After they fall out during a party at The Jockey, he tries to make amends. But discovers that weeks earlier, Kelly had sex with his father, Patrick. A heart-broken Shane later asks his father why he betrayed him. Patrick reveals that he felt shamed by his sons for abandoning him during that night, and in a moment of self-pity, paid Kelly for sex to "hurt" his son, but he now deeply regrets it. Shane demands that his father proves how sorry he is, and produces a syringe and a bag of heroin. As Paddy is about to inject himself, Shane stops him just in time. Satisfied with his father's remorse, he quietly leaves Paddy, who breaks down in tears. He is now married to Kelly-Marie Ball. They had their impromptu civil ceremony at The Jockey.
While giving a deposit to a sperm bank, Shane learned that he was sterile. Shane was upset at the thought of never having children. His father and brothers tried to help by offering to be sperm donors for Kelly, but she refused. Liam suggested Kelly and Shane raise Shane's niece Katie, but this plan was dashed when her father Lip decided to take her. Shane was left to look on Liam as a son.
When Carl and Chesney were framed for murder by a local drug-dealer called Jimmy, the Maguires initially decide to remain aloof from the situation, as it was "not their fight". But Jimmy's increasing cockiness revealed in Shane a sense of justice, when he began to openly speak against Jimmy's aggressive antics before taking overt action. When Jimmy tried to set the Gallagher home on fire, Shane stepped in, as he knew Jimmy was afraid to cross the Maguires. The last straw for Shane was when Jimmy promised to harm the family, including Liam. When Paddy elected to remain uninvolved, Shane and Jamie decided to take the law into their own hands despite their father's wishes, and rounded up members of Jimmy's gang, and brutally interrogated them as to Jimmy's whereabouts. Paddy later showed his face, and endorsed his son's proactiveness. Shane and Kelly have also developed a parental bond with Liam to the point where Liam even calls them mum and dad (albeit in jest) as they put him to bed.
In series 8 Shane attempts to take over the Maguire's business while Mimi is in hospital after suffering a heart attack. Jamie however feels that Shane is not up to the responsibility, and when he sees that Shane has been conned out of a drug deal, Jamie takes control by making Shane believe a gangster tried to have him killed. Jamie then encourages to shoot the gangster dead, not knowing that it was in fact Jamie who arranged for Shane to be left for dead until afterwards. A feud builds between the two throughout the first half of series 8.
Michael "Mickey" Maguire (born 20 June 1985) is a fictional character from the Channel 4 drama "Shameless"., he is a "paranoid, aggressive, violent, homosexual yet homophobe" who is a member of the Maguire family. He is erratic and obsessively licks the side of his mouth, which could be a tic and/or hint of a behavioral disorder. Despite his aggressive, exaggerated personality, he is mentally weak and often runs away at the first sign of trouble. Although his father Paddy often shows him disrespect and is violent towards him, Paddy still loves his son. Mickey is the most idealistic of his family, and the most loyal to his parents. In spite of Paddy's lack of faith in him, Mickey was the one who tracked down Paddy after he was shot and left for dead.
Mickey Maguire.
When Mickey initiates a brief and casual affair with Ian and falls in love with him, Mickey exhibits the fact that he is an eager suitor when he follows Ian around and is very emotionally demanding. Unlike Ian, none of Mickey's family are aware of his homosexuality, despite several occasions when Mickey has come close to coming out to them, or has daydreams about revealing his homosexuality to his family. In his early appearances, Mickey has a dog, Nelson, whom he has been close to for years. Ian is disgusted to learn just how close they had become at one time, and declines to continue a relationship with Mickey. By this time Mickey is in love with him and wants everyone to know. When Mickey is about to tell his family, Ian bursts into the room and tells them about what had happened with Mickey and Nelson. Paddy immediately has Nelson put down, deeply upsetting Mickey.
The early episodes of the sixth series show Mickey attending college to study film. When he reveals to his parents that he wants to pursue further education, Paddy and Mimi ridicule him. Later on in the series, Mimi accepts the fact that Mickey is going to college and supports her son in his educational endeavours. Unfortunately, Mickey struggles with the course and is distracted by an erotic story his professor accidentally slips in with his coursework. Mickey decides that his true talents are in erotic writing and gives up his place in the class for his mother, Mimi, who loves film and has always wanted to go to college.
In the seventh series, Mickey continues to build a friendship with Ian, with whom he shares a house. This series has proved that Mickey has a sensitive side, as explained through his dialogue with Ian when Ian became involved with Maxine Donnelly. Mickey tried to warn Ian that Maxine fancied him, not realising that Ian felt the same way about Maxine. Ian had sex with Mickey to get Maxine off his mind, but this didn't help, and he and Maxine had sex, which Mickey witnessed. Mickey was devastated when Ian insisted he cared for Maxine and wanted to be with her. Mickey told Ian that he'd felt like a freak before he'd had Ian to look up to, and now Ian had taken that away. Relations between Mickey and the new couple remained strained, but eventually Mickey decided to stop letting the relationship bother him. He told Maxine that all he wanted was that when she finally realises she cannot be happy with a gay man, that she let Ian down gently. Mickey leaves the show during series 9 after helping a young lady give birth to a baby. But after the lady passes away Mickey decides to move away from Chatsworth to look after the baby. When saying goodbye to Mimi as he is on the verge of telling her he is gay she silences him and tells him to keep in contact. Mimi implies that she has guessed he is gay.
Amanda "Mandy" Maguire (26 August 1987 – 5 May 2009) was the only daughter of the Maguires, the Gallagher family's neighbours. She is the mother of Lip's daughter, Katie. Mandy is the daughter of Paddy and Mimi Maguire, the most feared of the local criminals. She is generally more law-abiding than the rest of her family, but is fiercely loyal to them and can often have a violent and abusive streak. Her brothers are Micky, Shane and Jamie, as well as the late Fergal and the little-seen Donny and Joey.
Mandy Maguire.
She develops a crush on Ian in series 1 because he stuck up for her against their teacher Mrs. Novacovic, but sends her brothers after him when he rejects her. She is the second person to find out about his homosexuality. She becomes a close friend to Ian and pretends to date him to keep leering boys away from her, leading to her relationship with Ian's brother Lip.
Mandy conceives Lip's baby, Katie and after a year or so under the care of the Maguires, takes her away and moves in with the Gallaghers. However her father Paddy continues to supply her with financial support. She begins an open, long-term relationship with Lip while he is away at university, but finishes with him in series 5 after Lip's secret university girlfriend shows her face, she spends the whole series being rejected by every man she's attracted to until she goes on a blind date with a young man named Dex whom she gives him an E and sleeps with him, until she realizes she might have killed him so she & Karen try to dispose of the body, and spend the episode horrified with their actions, until Mandy decides to turn herself in without telling them who supplied her the drugs & who assisted her to dispose the body, she then learns Dex wasn't really dead but just passed out from the drugs, Mandy decides to come clean to him only for him to reject her.
In Series 6, Mandy has recently fallen for Joe Pritchard, an accountant and the captain of a local football team. Mandy's brother, Jamie, even struck up a friendship with Joe, until he discovered that Mandy had been physically abused by him, which led to Jamie savagely assaulting Joe, and sending him into a temporary coma. Despite suffering at Joe's hands, Mandy still retains feelings for him, and resented Jamie's intervention, Danny (Ian's new roommate) gives her a word of advice after he tells her he loves her, which makes her reconsider and then Frank brings up Katie eventually finding out which makes her decide to break it off with him only for Joe to blackmail her into staying with him, Joe's recovery, Mandy has decided to give him another chance, much to the chagrin of the rest of the Maguires, only for them to make supplemental threats to him, Jamie (cutting his head off), Paddy (shooting him), Shane (pissing on grapes), Kelly (injecting him) & Karen (threatening to tell them if Joe threatens to tell Jamie of their affair).
In the final episode of series 6, Mandy was kidnapped by Maureen, an emotionally unstable woman who lost her daughter to heroin and blames Paddy Maguire for her death. Mandy realised that Maureen was the person who kidnapped Paddy. As Maureen disappeared to put the kettle on, Mandy followed to see what she was doing, and to her horror, found a broken gas pipe which Maureen had sabotaged. Maureen then returned to the kitchen with matches. Mandy desperately began fighting to get the matches from Maureen just as Paddy and Mickey turned up outside to save her, however they could not gain access into the house. Inside the house, Mandy had fought her way into the hallway and ran towards the door. Just as Micky pressed the doorbell, creating a spark, Maureen lit a match. The gas then ignited, causing the house to explode, killing both Maureen and Mandy and throwing Micky across the street. The episode then cut to Kelly, reading a book to little Katie whilst trying to hold back the tears. Meanwhile, at the Jockey, Mandy's funeral reception was taking place. Micky, who survived the blast, admitted that he felt responsible for Mandy's death. It was mentioned that Paddy was going to return to Ireland with Mandy's ashes to scatter them, however Frank ended up spilling them across the Jockey.
In Series 8, Mandy briefly appears as an apparition or hallucination to comfort her mother.
Donny Maguire is the son of Paddy and Mimi Maguire. He is portrayed as being more thuggish than the rest of his brothers, quite often seen using violence against other people, including electrocution, attempted murder and hands on combat. He appeared in the show on a recurring basis throughout the first three series, whenever his family had problems to deal with on the Chatsworth Estate. He is first seen chasing Ian Gallagher after being told that he has assaulted his sister Mandy. Mandy later admits to lying, and Donny stops harassing Ian. He is next seen when he is ordered to collect Ian for his parents as he has "impregnated" Mandy. He attends their engagement party at the Jockey, where he gets into a fight with Lip Gallagher, Kev Ball, Marty Fisher and other locals. In series 3, he assists Paddy in tracking down and torturing a deaf teenage boy suspected of robbing the shop, which led to Mandy getting hurt. He later kicks him off a multi-story car park when he uses a paint can to insult the Maguire boys. He is last seen hunting down Carl Gallagher after Mimi and his brother Shane think Carl has grassed them up to the police. When his family moved to Chatsworth, Donny was not present and has not been seen since, with no explanation to his whereabouts. The character of Donny seems to have been completely forgotten, along with his brother Joey, as his mother Mimi often forgets to mention his name when talking about her kids.
Joey Maguire is the son of Paddy and Mimi. He appears in only one episode in Series 2, with a minor role. Like his brother Donny, he is the most short-lived Maguire boy and is also portrayed as nothing more than a thug to retain his family's feared status on the Chatsworth Estate. In his only appearance on the show, he bundles Ian Gallagher into a car and attends Ian and his sister Mandy's engagement party, where he is involved in a pub brawl. He is seen briefly at Jamie and Karen's wedding at the end of series four, singing along with his brothers Shane and Mickey. He has not been seen or mentioned since.
Karen Maguire (née Jackson; born 12 June 1988), is the daughter of Sheila Jackson and her second husband, Eddie Jackson. Nigel and Delia are her half-brother and sister. She becomes estranged from both parents throughout the series. She is Lip Gallagher's girlfriend in series 1, but seduces Lip's father Frank and has an affair with him. She then leaves to stay with her grandmother but later returns to work at The Jockey, the local pub. She is the only other character aside from Frank Gallagher to appear in every series.
Karen Maguire.
Karen becomes considerably more mature in series 4, at the end of which she marries the recently freed Jamie Maguire, with whom she co-runs the pub. Season 5 sees her becoming increasingly, albeit grudgingly, more integrated with the Maguire family and their somewhat violent way of life. Karen suffers a miscarriage early in season 6 and very soon after, her changing behavior and the loss of their child starts creating a large rift in their marriage. As she and Jamie argue over shared ownership of The Jockey and other problems, Karen finds herself drawn to her sister-in-law, Mandy's, abusive boyfriend Joe Pritchard, and has sex with him shortly after Jamie moves out. Joe becomes increasingly controlling, threatening to reveal their affair, and makes a failed attempt to buy out Jamie's portion of The Jockey. During this, the Maguires find out Joe has been physically abusing Mandy, and Jamie is almost sent back to prison after brutally beating him. When Jamie moves back in with Karen, she is able to end her affair with Joe by threatening him that if she claims to the Maguires that he's once again been beating Mandy, they will murder him. The last episode of series 6 reveals Karen to be once again pregnant; however she is unsure whether the father is Jamie Maguire or Joe, who laughs and tells her "You belong to me now."
In the first episode of series 7, Karen is two weeks overdue in her pregnancy, and can't wait to have the birth over and done with. When Mimi tells her that sex several times a day could make her waters break quicker, Karen tells that "they've" been "at it" all the time, and flashbacks show that she's been having sex with both Jamie and Joe, implying that her brief affair with Joe from series 6 has continued, despite Karen's often cold attitude towards him. In the same episode, Karen goes into labour after having a brief confrontation with Joe in the empty bar of the Jockey (Everybody else were celebrating at Frank's birthday party). After taunting her, Joe decided to help a scared Karen deliver what could be his son, who would be christened Connor Joseph Maguire. Despite playing happy families with "proud dad" Jamie, Joe tells that she's kidding herself into thinking that she wants Jamie, when she really only wants Joe, branding Jamie "boring". Karen would then engage in risky sex in the Maguires' living room with Joe, nearly being caught out by Paddy. Afterwards, Joe would declare that he loves her and they should be a family. Along with Karen's out of control behavior with Joe, she starts to act strange and starts losing Connor on a regular basis. For example, she hides her baby in a dresser drawer. On the third episode of the 7th series Karen starts to act in a strange manner by becoming obsessed with exercising and thinking that she can start her own fitness business, bouncing on a trampoline outside, going out late at night to buy groceries and putting baby Connor in a wardrobe. Karen's erratic behaviour deteriorates further as she starts ripping wall paper off the walls and playing music at high volume, even attempting suicide by falling from a window at one point. She is saved from her suicide attempt by a quick-thinking Paddy Maguire, who shows his sensitive side when he expresses deep care and sympathy for her. Finally Karen has to be restrained by medics and is placed in a psychiatric unit. Karen is diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When she returns home, she struggles to repair her marriage to Jamie, who is unable to have sex with her because the image of Karen during her breakdown is deeply ingrained in his mind. Jamie, unknown to Karen, begins having sex with other women for money, and to get away from her. Jamie does not derive any pleasure from having sex with other women and is motivated by the financial gain. Eventually he stops prostituting himself when Paddy discovers what Jamie has been up to and tries to be happy with Karen.
As much as Karen is repulsed by the sordid nature of her affair with Joe, she is also drawn to it, and is disappointed when Joe briefly stops seeing her. When he begins going to anger management meetings, Karen repeatedly tries to taunt him, throwing cereal around his shop and offering to resume their fling, but he refuses. Karen, pretending to be Joe's wife, drops into one of his meetings and listens to him as he talks about his attempts to control himself and how much he cares about her and their son.
The uneasy distance between Joe and Karen continues until Joe's father dies. Joe wants to start a new life with Karen and Connor and pushes Karen repeatedly to take Connor and leave Jamie. She also stops taking her medication, with her more erratic personality being closer to Joe than to Jamie. Joe eventually takes matters into his own hands, telling Jamie that he's sleeping with his wife, and he wants her and "their" son. Feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what she wants, she leaves with Joe, warning him that Jamie will kill them. In retaliation, Jamie digs up Joe's dead father, and confronts them outside the store, telling Karen it is her last chance to come home with him, and leaving the body at the side of the building. She stays with Joe, but soon begins to question her choice as she starts taking her bipolar meds again. After some close scrapes, Joe and Karen manage to sneak Connor away from Jamie, and Joe announces they're leaving the Chatsworth estate, although Karen is becoming increasingly unsettled at both the idea of a future with Joe and the feeling that Joe's decided what will happen without giving her a choice. She confides her worries to Ian Gallagher, who sneaks into the trunk of the car right before they leave the estate, worried for Karen and Connor. As Karen's doubts rattle Joe, she is subjected to verbal and finally physical abuse. When Karen attempts to call Jamie, telling Joe this was all a mistake and she had to go home and fix things, Joe begins strangling her. Ian gets out of the trunk, and repeatedly hits Joe in the back of the head while in an act of self defense until he releases her and falls to the ground. Telling Karen to take Connor back and do whatever it takes to make it work with Jamie, he drags Joe's body to the trunk and then drives the car away.
In Series 8 Karen returns to speak to Jamie, and they begin going to marital counseling, during which Karen admits that she made a mistake, and tells Jamie that Joe is dead, although not how he died. After several rough sessions in which he makes it clear that he finds it difficult to forgive her, Jamie tells her that he wants her and Connor back home, and that they will have to see if it can work out. At the beginning of her voiceover for episode four, he lets her out of the cab, and she walks through the Chatsworth estate, with jeers of "slag" and "slapper" being yelled by others, and egg thrown at her. She meets back up with Jamie at the Jockey, where he gives everyone 30 seconds for people to say whatever they like to her, before they accept that she's his wife and he won't allow it to continue. He then headbutts one man who passed the allotted time before walking out of the room, leaving Karen standing alone. Still feeling like an outcast and wanting badly to make her marriage work again, it's only after she runs into Frank at the hospital that she realizes she's tired of being judged for her past mistakes.
Jamie used his power of attorney while Karen was ill to put the Jockey solely in his name, and at first he is very cold towards her after her return, ignoring her suggestions and making it clear that the pub was no longer hers, but his and run with Mimi, leaving Karen feeling very left out. She explains to him that she knows she has to earn his trust back, and just wants him to give her a chance. After Jamie is overwhelmed by the chaos of trying to organize Libby's wedding party, he asks Karen to help them, finally acknowledging that he does need her, and does appreciate her. Later, he takes her back into their bed and things begin to return to normal for the couple.
Karen briefly tries to run a clown business before several male customers attempt to assault her, during which she shoots one in the thigh with one of the Maguire's stolen guns. In a later episode, we see her standing in front of the Jockey, scowling up at the "Jamie Maguire, proprietor" sign. After winning a card game from Jamie, she demands that he return the pub to her. The couple is then later seen standing in front of the pub looking at two signs, one of which says "under new management," and the other saying "Jamie and Karen Maguire, proprietors."
In series 9 Karen has returned to her former, stable self. She invites half the estate to stay with her when they're evicted, and also gets into a fight with Gloria, which is quickly settled. Karen is unaware for some time that Jamie has begun an affair with Gloria, a fact that is hidden from her even when Jamie is trapped with others underground, although Dominic does find out at this time. Karen later realizes Jamie is possibly having an affair, and asks for the help of Gloria and others to find out who it is, worried that perhaps it is her condition causing paranoia. At the end of the episode, she sees Jamie and Gloria together, and realizes who he was having an affair with all along.
Several episodes later Karen and Connor's lives appear to be in danger, with Jamie receiving threatening phone calls and pictures of his family. Karen is attacked in the park while walking Connor. He attempts to go after enemies while trying to protect his wife and child, and later agrees to a ransom of 200,000 after Karen is kidnapped. After several car changes, he finds Karen as she walks out into the warehouse, revealing to him that she planned the whole thing, and that she knows about his affair. She explains that now she knows he does love her and she loves him, but that the secrets are going to stop. She's keeping the 200,000, and will now control the finances of his business, keeping Jamie in check. At the end of the episode, she tells him that if something happens to her, there is an unknown friend who knows everything about Jamie.
Kelly-Marie Maguire (née Ball; born 1983) is Kev Ball's sister. A recovered heroin addict, she became a prostitute and inspired Lillian Tyler to open up a brothel, and struck up a relationship with Shane Maguire, which ended under intimidation from Paddy Maguire. She returned a couple of episodes later, telling Shane she "decided not to take his father's offer". This resulted in Shane confronting Paddy, who beat him up in The Jockey. At the end of series 5 Kelly-Marie announces she is pregnant with Shane's child, and is welcomed into the family with open arms by Paddy and Mimi. In series 6 it is revealed by Kelly that she had had a "phantom pregnancy", and was comforted by Mimi and Shane.
Kelly Maguire.
During her early appearances on the show, Kelly had a hostile relationship with her sister-in-law Veronica, who was the one that eventually discovered her addiction to heroin, and helped Kelly get clean by locking her in the bathroom against her will, she would later return to Chatsworth looking for a room to rent and Frank used it as opportunity to collect cash from her, and allows her to live with him & Sheila but little do they know that's she's a prostitute and kick her out because of it.
In Series 4 she returns once again and tries to convince Frank once again to move in when him much to his dissaproval, next she tries to convince Lip to move into the middle apartment in which Mandy immediately blows off, next tries to convince Jamie to move in with him, in which Karen refuses (do to using her old room as a whore house) so she moves in with Lillian and in season 5 suggests she opens up a brothel in which turns out to be successful, she becomes involved with Shane, until Paddy pays her off and she coldly breaks up with Shane, she returns near the end and tells Shane everything in which leads to a violent confrontation with his father, touched that he stood up for her admits her feelings to him, she later finds out about a pregnancy scare and while she's doing that finds Katie (Mandy's daughter) and brings her back thus earning the respect of the entire Maguire family.
In series 7, Kelly is chosen initially by Jamie and Karen to be the godmother of their newborn son, Connor Joseph Maguire. She and Shane have also actively dealt in personal side jobs in addition to the normal Maguire family business.
In the fourth episode of Series 7, Kelly has sex with Paddy in exchange for money, after Paddy found it hard to "pull" on a night out with his sons. Paddy wanted to hurt Shane since he felt Shane had not been there for him. Paddy and Kelly kept their encounter a secret, but during a mass wedding scam, Shane proposed to Kelly. Kelly turned him down several times, even ending their relationship, because she could not marry him while living a lie. Shane told her he would forgive her sleeping with anyone, at which point she and a guilty Paddy made eye contact. Shane was devastated to learn the truth, but forgave Kelly, and they married in a civil ceremony at the Jockey.
Shane was deeply upset when he learned he was sterile. Jamie, Micky, and Paddy offered to be Kelly's sperm donors, but she refused, saying she'd already had Paddy in her once and wasn't going to do that ever again. As they would be unable to adopt a child, Liam convinced them to try to be parents to Shane's niece Katie. This plan was dashed when Katie's father Lip decided to take a more active role in her life. Kelly and Shane decided to give up on their plans and just be honorary parental figures for Liam, whom she has grown quite fond of.
Kelly was revealed in the thirteenth episode of series 7 to have a fifteen-year-old half-sister named Tonya, whose care she was briefly responsible for. Kelly and Tonya were both fathered by a man named Homer. It was implied that he abused them both sexually. Tonya had a baby-boy named Enrico, who was in foster-care. Micky Maguire, who pretended to be Shane during a visit from a social-care worker during his brother's absence, found out from Tonya that Enrico was actually born out of incest with her father, who raped her. She begged him not to tell Kelly. After finding out that Homer abused them both, Micky injected tranquilizer into Homer's blood-stream in The Jockey toilets, and dragged him with Shane's help to a slaughter-house to dispose of him, doing his sister-in-law a tremendous favour in the process.
In series 8 Kelly falls out of love with Shane and begins seeing Marty, who later she becomes with pregnant with. Kelly and Shane break up and her and Marty start their lives together. In series 9 Kelly loses the baby in an accident, leading to a breakdown of constant drinking and drug abuse.

He returned in series 8, when he snatched Cilla without Mimi noticing. He and Mimi married on the last episode of Series 8.
Billy Tutton.
Billy is often portrayed as unreliable and childish; therefore mocked by most of the Chatsworth community. Numerous times he has tried to prove himself worthy to the Maguire sons and the local community by demonstrating that he can be mature and ruthless, but to no avail.
Ruby Hepburn (1991-2012) is the niece of Mimi Tutton. She arrives from Glasgow to live with her aunt and cousins, Shane and Mickey, in Chatsworth and her looks immediately attract the attentions of many residents, including Shane.

Kevin Alan "Kev" Ball (born 31 January 1974) worked in the local public house, The Jockey, and was the next door neighbour of the Gallagher family.
The Ball/Fisher family.
Kev Ball.
He is also the brother of Kelly Maguire (née Ball).
Kev's marriage to Veronica is legally invalid because he never got a divorce from his first wife, Roxy, who Kevin left because of spousal abuse. He told Veronica the situation prior to their wedding. However, having discovered that Veronica's late father had left £5,000 to pay for his daughter's wedding, Veronica and Kev decided to go through with a sham wedding in order to get the wedding money. Their plan was to use the money to buy their council house. Following the sham ceremony, the reception venue was set alight by Veronica's pyromaniac brother Marty. Kev and Veronica had to use the £5,000 to compensate the owners of the venue for the fire damage caused by Marty.
Kev is illiterate. And despite having lessons on and off over the years, has had limited success, until Veronica agreed to help him out once she learned that the instructor from his adult literacy class was sexually harassing him.
Kev has also taken boxing lessons from his late father during childhood; a skill he attempts to pass onto his foster child (Eric) in Series 2, Episode 2. He is also referred to several times in the same episode as "Kelvin Ball".
Kev and Veronica appeared briefly in the first episode of the fourth series. They were shown being brought into a Romanian courthouse. They had been arrested after attempting to buy an orphan.
He returned in Series 8 for the 100th episode as a guest character. He and Veronica are still together and seem to have been released by the Romanian authorities at some unspecified date.

Returning to Chatsworth temporarily, he helps Carl, Kelly and the Maguires to prove Frank's innocent in a violent attack on an elderly lady. After this, he returns to Nottingham.
Veronica Carol "Vee" Ball (née Fisher; born 19 June 1974) is Carol Fisher's daughter and Marty Fisher's older sister. She has four other brothers called Mitch, Phil, Leo and Barry. She is also Fiona's best friend. Veronica lived next door to the Gallaghers with husband Kev, although their marriage is not legal due to Kev still being married to his first wife, Roxy.
Veronica Ball.
She stated that she and Kev thought they were rough, until the Gallaghers moved in next door, which made the two feel like Charles and Camilla. Veronica was on very friendly terms with Debbie, and often defended her in certain situations.
Veronica has a rather bitter relationship with most of her family, especially her mother Carol, who often behaves with a dismissive and ungrateful attitude toward her daughter.
Days before Frank and Sheila's wedding in series 3, Veronica learned that Sheila's first husband, Sheldon, was buried in the back garden with his gold jewellery. After learning that her and Kev's IVF had failed, she conspired with Frank to dig up the body to recover the valuables, only to discover that Sheldon had been stabbed. After the gold medallions were taken, Veronica was sorely disappointed to find out they were cheap fakes. Veronica discovers from Sheila that Sheldon used to beat and torment her by burning her with his medallions, until she snapped and stabbed him. Veronica and Kev then convinced Frank not to allow Sheila to turn herself in to the police.
Later in the show on the start of a season Kev and Veronica were seen on TV when apprehended by Romanian authorities for attempting to buy a child from an orphanage. This came sudden and was unknown where they were till the TV report. They were jailed for up to 6 years.
Veronica and Kev both now live in Nottingham having been released from a Romanian prison by the authorities. While Veronica is never seen in person on the show again, Kev returned to the show for an episode on 27 September 2011.
Carol Fisher (1945–2011) is the mother of Marty and Veronica. She was a guest character in the first series of "Shameless", later becoming a main character (along with her son) in series two. She is a pathological kleptomaniac and a bossy and demanding woman, fond of having affairs with much younger men. Carol is also best friends with nosy neighbour Lillian Tyler. In series 3, she found out that Lillian had an affair with her husband Malcolm in the 1970s.
Carol Fisher.
Carol is very promiscuous for her age. In series 3, she embarked on a relationship with a man named Norman. She later found out that he was a nudist. Their relationship ended when he urinated on her during sex. Carol is also quite religious, although she somehow is able to balance it with her promiscuous nature.
Carol moved in with Kev and her daughter Veronica after Marty burned her house down when he left prison and found her with another man. She then moved in with the Gallaghers after Veronica kicked her and Marty out in order to foster a child. Carol then moved in to The Jockey. Absent from series 5, Karen revealed in Episode 1 that Carol had "fucked off to Magaluf with 2 months takings," from The Jockey, before flashing to a picture on the wall of Carol which read 'Employee of the month.'
It's revealed in Series 8, Episode 17 by her son Marty that Carol has died.
Martin Andrew "Marty" Fisher (born 1978) is the son of Carol Fisher, and brother of Veronica. Marty has coprolalic Tourette's syndrome and is a pyromaniac. He was a guest character in the first series of Shameless, became a main character (along with his mother) in series two, and left along with Veronica and Kev in the first episode of season four. Marty was originally something of a burden to the other characters, setting things alight when he got angry, particularly whenever he found Carol with much younger men. At one point he burns Carol's house down when he finds her having sex in the shower with his best friend, as well as burning down the toilets of the Jockey when Veronica attempts to have him sent back to prison after he escaped to attend her wedding; incidents like this have landed him in prison several times. His tourette's syndrome often creates uncomfortable situations for him, causing him to reveal otherwise secret information or offend those who are not used to him by insulting/swearing. However, later in the series Debbie teaches Marty to use other words such as buttermilk and spongecake instead of swearing, and his pyromania seems to calm down when he starts a relationship with Sue Garland. The two live relatively happily in the Gallagher household for a time, until Marty accompanies Kev and Veronica in a scheme to buy a Romanian baby from an orphanage. Marty escapes back to the Chatsworth with the stolen orphan and suggests to Sue that they raise it as their own. Initially Sue is reluctant but later saves the baby from being sent back by the police. Sue reveals that she is pregnant with Marty's child and the two leave the estate (how they find the money to do this is unclear).
Marty Fisher.
He returns in Series 8, Episode 17. Marty reveals that him and Sue lived happily for years in Spain with their kids, only for Sue to cheat on him with a rich local and kick him out of the house. Not knowing where else to go, Marty flees back to the Chatsworth and begins squatting in a flat once occupied by heroin addicts, and on the run from the CSA for not paying child maintenance. Presumably, he found his mother Carol (who left to go to Maguluf), as he returns with her urn. Shortly after returning Marty causes tension between Shane and Kelly Maguire by telling Kelly that he loves her.

He returned for the eleventh series shortly before leaving with Kelly for good.
Libby Croker is one of Frank's third major love interest. She is a librarian who lives with her disabled mother, for whom she is sole carer, giving up her own independent existence. Libby is narcoleptic. In the most recent episode, she has moved in with Frank, after being released from prison for inciting a riot. Her mother has also moved in with the Gallaghers, living in their front room, and has been set up as a counterpoint to Frank, both of whom consider the other as "fakers" regarding their illnesses. Libby's moving into the Gallagher home has not been welcomed by Frank's sons. Liam in particular has demonstrated a rather cold attitude toward Libby, perhaps because he fears that the relationship is doomed to failure anyway, and doesn't want to get too friendly with Libby. However, Libby has gradually been accepted by most of the family. In episode 13 of Series 8 Libby was found to be exchanging love letters with a colleague. The colleague was later found out to be a figment of her imagination borne out of a desperate need for affection.

Yvonne Karib.
Yvonne converted to Islam to marry Kash, and is far more devout than her now estranged husband. Although white, she always wears Asian dress and was originally never seen without a hijab, although she no longer wears one.
It is implied that Yvonne came from a racist family, due to her refusal to go home to them after being made homeless in the last episode of series 4. During this episode, Yvonne moved into the house between the Gallaghers and the Maguires after arranging to rent it from Fiona and Steve. Season 5 sees her begin a relationship with police officer Stan Waterman.

He was briefly the Young Mayor of Chatsworth and love interest of Debbie Gallagher, until he admits to using her and not having the slightest interest in her or her intentions in trying to make the town a better place. However, Chesney was using the campaign funds to help an elderly Pakistani woman to take her British Citizenship Test, thus earning Debbie's respect (despite thinking his reasoning for doing so was silly but still admires that he helped someone and didn't ask for anything in return). Chesney is a smart but moody teenager who quietly resents his mother's bossy and abrupt demeanour.
Chesney Karib.
In series 6, Chesney finds out that his mother had faked his father's death. Kash then attends the shop in order to speak with his son. In a moment of rage, Chesney knocks his father out cold, and seemed to be prepared to bludgeon him with a baseball bat when the fireworks that were stacked up in the shop's stockroom were ignited, due to the spreading flames of Chesney's insufficiently stamped out cigarette. Chesney flees the store, leaving his unconscious father to die for real from smoke inhalation, a crime for which Chesney should have been arrested and sent to prison. Having discovered his parents duplicity, Chesney began to openly defy Yvonne by liberally taking money from the till and drinking in the house.
In series 7, Chesney helps his mother and Stan Waterman cheat Paddy Maguire out of the money they owed him. He continues to work at the Kash and Carry after Joe Pritchard purchases the shop from Yvonne. Things begin to go badly for Chesney a party thrown at his house takes an abrupt turn when a drunk girl is taken advantage of, and the boy that transpired the events gets battered to death by the girl's older brother. The act was filmed and spread via photographs over a mobile phone. Chesney and Carl Gallagher were witnesses to the assault. Their consciences soon got the better of them, which led them to grafittying the name of the killer close to the scene of the crime.
The murderer, Jimmy, in turn prevented them from going forward to the police by threatening to kill Liam, and tells them to leave Chatsworth. After spending some time at a Welsh farm with a woman called Hazel, who has her own murky past which Chesney helped her resolve, both he and Carl decided to return to Chatsworth to clear their names. When entering a football competition for gays, Chesney argues with Ian over his (Ian's) homosexual relationship with Kash long-ago.
