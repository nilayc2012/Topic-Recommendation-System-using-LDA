 <p>The Legend of Tarzan is an American animated television series created by The Walt Disney Company in 2001, based on the Tarzan character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The series aired on ABC from July 13 to September 7, 2002 as part of its "Disney's One Saturday Morning" lineup until it was moved to UPN's "Disney's One Too" lineup. "The Legend of Tarzan" picks up where the 1999 feature film left off, with the title character adjusting to his new role as leader of the apes following Kerchak's death, and Jane (whom he has since married) adjusting to life in the jungle.
Rounding out the cast are Jane's father, Professor Archimedes Q. Porter; Tantor, the germophobic elephant; and Terk, a wisecracking female gorilla and Tarzan's old wrestling buddy.
Broadcast.
In late 2001, Disney Channel added "The Legend of Tarzan" to their lineup. Reruns continued until September 2, 2003, when the series (along with "Fillmore!" and "Buzz Lightyear of Star Command") was pre-empted in favor of a 90-minute showing of "Recess". Reruns aired on Toon Disney until 2009 and it ran on Disney XD from 2009 to 2012.
Critical reception.
CommonSenseMedia gave the show a rating of 3 stars out of 5, writing "Despite the show's charms, it doesn't quite live up to the original film. But it does teach viewers about the responsibilities of growing up -- the good, the bad, and, of course, the funny -- and it's definitely something that families can watch together, especially as it spends a lot of time focusing on family dynamics." The Hour praised the show for having Disney-quality animation, for being faithful to the film's storyline, and for giving viewers a chance to discover what happens after the movie ends. However, it noted the voice actors are not the same and said the voice of Terk is "really annoying".
In 2002, the show was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award and two Golden Reel Awards.
