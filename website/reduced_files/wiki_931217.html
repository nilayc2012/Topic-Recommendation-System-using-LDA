 <p>Domenica is the daughter of Janice and Bobby Baccalieri. She was born sometime in 2005, after her parents got married. Getting her registered for a pre-school was the reason why Janice and Bobby were not able to take care of Junior the night he shot Tony. Domenica rode the amusement ride with her mother at the Feast of St. Elzéar when it broke. She longed for another ride and Tony later spun her around at the feast, to her joy. That year, Janice took Domenica to Satriale's Pork Store to demand that Tony make Bobby a capo. In 2007, Domenica played at the house near the lake when Tony, Carmela, Bobby, and Janice celebrated Tony's birthday. Janice kept her away from the water in fear she could drown.
Anthony "Tony B." Blundetto.
Tony Soprano's cousin, who was imprisoned and soon thereafter became embroiled in a life of crime. Tony B. gets his massage license and tries to set up a massage business. He sabotages the business before it gets off the ground, and goes back to crime. Tony S. sets him up in the airbag scam, but it is not enough money for Tony B. To earn extra money, he performs a contract hit for Rusty and Angelo. After Angelo is killed, Tony B. kills Billy Leotardo in retaliation, igniting dangerous tensions with the New York crew. To bring peace with Johnny Sack (and to avoid Tony B.'s being tortured to death by Phil Leotardo), Tony S. kills Tony B. by shooting him in the face with a shotgun.
Quintina is Livia's younger sister, a widow, and the mother of Tony Blundetto. Quintina, or "Aunt Quin" as people call her, is first seen when she and Livia are planning to board a plane for Arizona. However, because the tickets are stolen, the FBI questions her and Livia. She tries to keep connected with Tony Blundetto's ex-wife and children but hasn't seen then since Tony was incarcerated. Tony B. lives with his mother for a short time after being paroled from prison. She is very nervous and always trying to look out for Tony B. and his twin sons, Jason and Justin Blundetto. When Livia was having her "change of life" baby after Barbara Soprano and had a miscarriage and almost died from the miscarriage, Quintina left a note for Anthony and told him to find Johnny Boy.
Brian is Carmela's cousin and a financial advisor. He assisted her in planning her estate when she worried over her own and her children's futures should anything happen to Tony. Tony and Brian became friends and Brian could later be seen accompanying Tony to parties at Bada Bing (for Paulie's homecoming) and Chief Smith's casino, drinking and enjoying the strippers. Tony set Brian up with Patsy to get cheap designer suits. Brian was also responsible for giving Tony the idea for the HUD scam. Later, he attended Hugh De Angelis' birthday party at Tony's home. Also, he and his wife accompanied Tony and Carmela to an Elton John/Billy Joel concert. Years later, in season 6 part 2, Brian and his pregnant wife bought Carmela's spec house.
Carmela's father who is in his mid 70s. Hugh has been married to Mary for over 40 years and is a resident of West Orange, New Jersey. He is a former sailor in the United States Navy and spent time in Nova Scotia during the war. Although now semi-retired, Hugh had worked as a contractor, and he built Tony and Carmela's house. Almost everyone in the Soprano family consider Hugh a classy, old-school gentleman for whom tradition and respect are very important values. He has an affable and kindly manner, but does not hesitate to speak his mind on points of disagreement with family, particularly his wife. Hugh enjoys hunting and playing with Hot Wheels die cast cars with his grandson Anthony Jr. He is a member of the Knights of Columbus as evidenced by the custom-designed cake presented to him at his birthday celebration. He was considered a "wild man" in his youth; one time he had a physical altercation with a motorcycle gang and another time he disrupted a meeting of the German-American Bund by throwing a cherry bomb at its members.
Hugo "Hugh" De Angelis.
Hugh and Mary eat Sunday dinner with Carmela and Tony when they are all on good terms. Hugh also has a brother named Lester and a sister named Lena, who is actually the mother of Christopher Moltisanti's father Dickie, thus making Hugh Chris' great uncle. During Carmela and Tony's separation, Hugh was eager to see Tony whenever possible and often took Tony's side in family discussions. This is due to Hugh's strong sense of tradition and respect for the traditional home and family. He did not want to be present at a family gathering if "the man of the house" was not there (in the episode "Marco Polo"). Hugh became involved in a real estate investment with Carmela involving a spec house. However, construction of the spec house was halted after a building inspector found that low-quality wood had been used. Carmela blamed her father for the setback and Hugh became angry that Carmela was treating him as a subordinate rather than a partner. After Tony's shooting, Hugh steals items from the house's storage garage and abandons the house. Carmela discovers this months later and scolds him about the permit - Hugh again becomes enraged at her attitude. Their feud leaves Mary meeting with Tony and Carmela alone while Hugh stays home. Carmela and Hugh reconciled enough for him to attend Christmas celebrations at the Soprano home later that year - after Carmela's spec house started to go ahead again.
Carmela's mother who is in her mid 70s. Mary has been married to her husband Hugh De Angelis for over 40 years. Mary and Hugh have a long marriage, but she does nag her husband quite a bit and tends to treat Hugh as a subordinate rather than a husband, a theme that reappears in Hugh's relationship with both his wife and his daughter Carmela. Shortly after Carmela began dating Tony Soprano, she became extremely protective of her daughter and tried to prevent her from marrying him. After Carmela got married, the De Angelises met Tony's mother, Livia Soprano, with whom they became very angry after Livia told Carmela that "Tony would get bored of her." Mary had a brother named Febby who died of cancer. Mary and Hugh started seeing Carmela more often after Livia was put in a nursing home. Mary has tried to prevent Tony from attending Hugh's 75th birthday party in fear that he would embarrass them in front of Russ and Lena Fegoli, her "cultured Italian friends." Mary wishes to appear as a WASP and is embarrassed by Italian stereotypes. (For example, Mary, when Meadow was born, was disappointed at her granddaughter's dark skin tone.) Carmela became angered at her suggestion to ban Tony from the party but decided to put the issue aside. Mary and Hugh continue to surface during family functions and Sunday dinners at the Soprano home. Mary also suffers from psoriasis.
Alyssa is the daughter of Barbara and Tom Giglione, sister of Thomas Giglione, niece of Tony and Carmela Soprano, and cousin of Meadow and AJ Soprano. She is seen during Sunday dinner at Uncle Junior's, witnessing Tony having an outburst because Junior repeatedly said, "He never had the makings of a varsity athlete." Alyssa also attends Chris and Kelly Moltisanti's house-warming party.
Tommy is the son of Barbara and Tom Gigilione, brother of Alyssa Giglione, nephew of Tony and Carmela Soprano, and cousin of Meadow and AJ Soprano. He is seen at Sunday dinner at Uncle Junior's, witnessing Tony having an outburst because Junior repeatedly said, "He never had the makings of a varsity athlete." Tommy also attends Chris and Kelly Moltisanti's house-warming party.
Barbara's husband and Tony and Janice's brother-in-law. He and Barbara live in Brewster, New York with their two children. Apparently he is not involved in criminal activities, and he should not be confused with the capo "Gigi" who died in the toilet. The reason Barbara gives Tony for being unable to stay with Uncle Junior in "Members Only" indicates that Tom works in show business. His father is killed one day after retiring, falling off a roof while trying to install a satellite dish. Although not a member of the crime family, Tom's marriage to Tony's little sister Barbara caused Tony to be on excellent terms with him, and he gave a "boost" (envelope with cash) to Tom at his father's funeral. Tony debated the death of Tom's father in therapy, but in front of his family he was genuinely upset at the loss of Tom's father, and angry that Meadow was too casual about the death. Tom originally sported a goatee and beard in the earlier seasons, but shaved in off in favor of a clean shaven look later on.
Barbara is the youngest child of Johnny and Livia Soprano, and sister of Tony and Janice. She is seen infrequently, usually only visiting her siblings for family functions, weddings or funerals. She lives in Brewster, New York and has two children with her husband, Tom. Barbara took part in caring for Junior Soprano as his dementia worsened.
Barbara Soprano Giglione.
In Season 6, after Tony's shooting by Uncle Junior, Barbara increased the level of contact with her siblings. She took part in keeping a round-the-clock vigil for Tony at the hospital and later attended family Sunday dinners at his home. She accompanied Janice to a viewing when Janice bought the Sacrimoni household and, in the series finale, was seen attending the wake of Janice's late husband, Bobby Baccalieri.
Harpo is the estranged Italian-American-French Canadian, Quebec French speaking son of Janice Soprano born in Seattle, Washington. Janice said he was named from the song "Harpo's Blues" by Phoebe Snow (as opposed to Harpo Marx). His father, named Eugene, took him back to Montreal, Canada and Janice states that she tried to petition the State Department to have him returned to her. In the episode "Proshai, Livushka," Janice mentions that Harpo had become homeless when Tony proposes flying him in for Livia's funeral. In season 5, she says she mentioned Harpo to Bobby once, but that the topic of him is never brought up in the family again. She tells Tony that he now goes by "Hal" instead of "Harpo."
Al is Kelli Moltisanti's father and Christopher's father-in-law. He owns several successful hardware stores in North New Jersey. Christopher pushed "Little Paulie" Germani out of a window because he allegedly stole tools from one of Al's hardware stores. Al appears to like Christopher. However, in episode "Kennedy and Heidi," after Christopher's death, Al expresses his frustration with Chris leaving his daughter a widow and his granddaughter fatherless by driving a car under the influence of cocaine.
Rita is Kelli Moltisanti's mother and Christopher's mother-in-law. In "Kennedy and Heidi," she mentions that the doctors said it was possible for Christopher to have survived the accident if they had gotten to him sooner.
Kelli was Christopher's new girlfriend in 2006. She became pregnant and planned to terminate the pregnancy, blaming herself for the lack of contraception. When she told Chris, he was actually overjoyed that Kelli was pregnant. Christopher bemoaned that his former fianceé Adriana could not have children and immediately suggested they go to Atlantic City and get married. Soon after their marriage, Kelli and Chris make an offer on a new home and move in. They also ate Sunday dinner with the Sopranos and Kelli complimented Tony on his (stolen) wine. Kelli became a regular at Soprano Sunday dinners - attending even when Christopher went to an AA meeting. Christopher's interest in Kelli began to drift and he began an affair with Julianna Skiff while his wife was still pregnant. Kelli remained devoted to Christopher and did not complain about his long absences. She attended the Sopranos' Christmas celebrations in 2006.
Kelli Lombardo Moltisanti.
In 2007, Kelli was now a mother, having given birth to her and Christopher's daughter Caitlin. She later attended her baptism when Tony and Carmela Soprano became Caitlin's godparents. In the episode "Walk Like a Man," Kelli had the idea to invite friends and family to her and Christopher's house for a barbecue and party. She was terrorized by Paulie Gualtieri when he drives his Cadillac CTS through their front yard in retaliation for Christopher throwing his nephew Little Paulie Germani out of a window. In the episode "Kennedy and Heidi," when Christopher died, Tony commented that Kelli's behavior at the funeral reminded him of Jackie Kennedy Onassis. She was last seen with Caitlin attending a dinner at the Soprano house with Tony and Carmela.
Joanne is the widow of Richard "Dickie" Moltisanti. After Christopher got revenge for his father's killing in For All Debts Public and Private he went to his mother's house to look through his father's things. He found an old picture of his father in a U.S. Navy uniform and gave it to his mother, thinking she would cherish such a picture, but she is later seen to put it face down on the table and not look at it. They then talked about Dickie, but she then proceeded to nag him about his drug abuse, to which Christopher retorted she is in no position to talk, given her alcoholism. Joanne attended Adriana La Cerva's bridal shower when she became engaged to Christopher. Later, she took part in an intervention for Christopher's drug addiction during which Christopher called her a whore. When Joanne's cousin Tony Blundetto killed Billy Leotardo, Christopher hid from Phil Leotardo at her townhouse. She was intimidated to the point of tears by Phil and Jason Masucci, but did not give up her son. The role of Joanne was played by actress Nancy Cassaro in only one episode, "From Where to Eternity;" thereafter the role was subsequently recast with actress Marianne Leone Cooper playing Joanne Moltisanti for the rest of the series.
Richard "Dickie" Moltisanti.
"See separate entry"
Corrado was the father of Junior Soprano and Johnny Soprano and Tony Soprano's paternal grandfather. He emigrated to America from Avellino, Italy in 1910 and worked as a master stonemason. He helped to build a church in Tony's old neighborhood, to which Tony occasionally brings his children, so that he can tell them about their heritage. Tony also recalls that when he was 13 his grandfather would let him play around on his construction sites, even allowing him to drive heavy machinery. Junior told a story about his old man smacking him in the mouth as a boy for refusing payment from a wealthy woman he helped. As punishment, Junior was forced to walk home, 11 miles away.
Ercole was Tony Soprano's late uncle, a brother of Junior and Johnny's who was born between them. Tony never met him and finds about his existence from Junior in "The Happy Wanderer". Ercole suffered from mental deficiencies and was institutionalized early in his life and his existence concealed. Junior explains that society did not understand these things back then, but praises his mother for making sure Ercole was taken care of. Junior also boasts to Tony that he and Johnny also paid for his care with their criminal proceeds. Ercole was named after Corrado and Johnny Soprano's grandfather (Ercole is Italian for Hercules) and shares the same name and nickname, Eckley, as former DiMeo family boss Ercole "Eckley" DiMeo. It is also reported that Ercole died not long before his brother Johnny Boy Soprano did, making his death presumably 1985 or 1986.
Tony's deceased father, the former captain of the Soprano crew. Johnny was married to Livia Pollio and they had three children: Janice, Tony, and Barbara. Johnny worked closely with his brother Junior during Tony's childhood. They both went on to become capos in the DiMeo crime family. Johnny was well liked in the organization - boss Ercoli DiMeo was thought to be considering him to take over before his death. Johnny's crew included Paulie Gualtieri and Salvatore "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero. Sal stood up for Johnny in the unrest of '83 and Johnny's leadership led to Sal becoming a made man shortly afterwards. Both Sal and Paulie followed Johnny's wishes and supported Tony becoming capo after Johnny's death of emphysema. Johnny took Tony and his friend Silvio Dante under his wing and brought them up in the organization as part of his crew.
John Francis "Johnny Boy" Soprano.
Johnny made many road trips to Florida with Paulie Gualtieri, where Johnny had a piece of a dog track. On Paulie's first trip in the South, sometime during the early 1960s, when Johnny and Paulie were in a 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz in Georgia they were pulled over by a state trooper and Paulie, who was 20 at the time and had never been outside of New Jersey, was driving without a driver's license and worried about what to tell the trooper. Johnny told Paulie to tell the state trooper that his cousin was a state trooper and gave Paulie a southern sounding name. When the trooper asked for the cousin's name, Paulie said 'Barney Fife'. The trooper then hit Paulie in the face, while Johnny laughed uncontrollably and resolved the issue by giving the trooper a one-hundred dollar bill.
Paulie also told Tony that his father loved him very much and that the only time he saw Johnny cry was when Tony was born. Tony told Paulie that he "never knew where he stood" with his father.
Johnny was only seen in flashbacks to Tony's childhood or in Tony's dream sequences. Tony once witnessed Johnny cut the pinky finger off of Mr. Satriale while Junior held him in place in the Fall of 1969; Satriale was a gambler who was avoiding giving Johnny payment. This event contributed to Tony's first panic attack at the kitchen table that evening. Tony also saw his father and Junior attack Rocco Alatore over a debt, then recalled his father discussing a possible move to Reno, Nevada in 1967 to manage a supper club for Alatore (now on good terms with Johnny since the debt was repaid) and his mother refusing, a move that Livia would later sweep under the rug when Mr. Alatore later became a billionaire with his investments. It is revealed in the episode "A Hit Is a Hit" that Johnny was a silent partner in Hesh Rabkin's record company "F-Note Records".
Tony also witnessed Johnny Boy plotting a scheme in 1967 at a children's carnival by bringing Janice along. Tony had originally thought that his father favored Janice over him, but later learned the truth, that mobsters brought their daughters to their meetings as a ruse. When Janice recalled the time Johnny shot through Livia's beehive hairdo while they were driving home, Tony thought the anecdote was shameful and made their family look "dysfunctional". Tony described his mother's relationship with his father as wearing him down to "a little nub". Johnny Boy also kept a mistress named Fran Felstein, whom he had met during Tony's childhood. In 1976, when Tony was 16, Johnny stayed all night at her home when his wife was pregnant and was in the hospital. The next morning Johnny and Tony went to the hospital and Tony lied to his mother saying they went to a New York Yankees baseball game and stayed in New York. Livia saw through Johnny's lie and lost the baby due to bleeding.
Through the various dream sequences and his therapy sessions, it appears Tony's relationship with his father was never as close as he presumed - an issue that Dr. Melfi attempted to engage but which was met with dismissal by Tony, who refused to delve deeply into his relationship with his father.
By the 1980s, Johnny Boy was a powerful and very well-respected Capo, with a crew consisting of Paulie Gualtieri and Big Pussy Bompensiero, Silvio Dante and his son Tony, among others. He held a controlling interest in Baron Sanitation and many other operations, including ownership of Satriale's Pork Store and co-ownership of Midget Horse Racing Track as well as having interests in horse tracks as far south as Florida. He also owned property in what is now Tribeca Square. Around this time, he had begun a friendship and business association with John Sacrimoni, which would be inherited by Tony after his death. This longstanding friendship strengthened the DiMeo Family's longstanding ties to the powerful Lupertazzi Crime Family in New York.
In September 1982, when Tony was 22 years old, and just two weeks before the birth of his granddaughter Meadow, Johnny Boy ordered his son to murder a local bookie nicknamed "Willie Overall." This was Tony's first murder and it helped hasten his climb toward becoming a made man in the Dimeo Family.
Johnny Boy died of Emphysema in late 1986 at the age of 62. Not long before his death, he saw the incarceration of many of his fellow DiMeo family associates due to Fabian "Febby" Petrulio becoming a government witness; it is stated that he never recovered from the news of Febby's betrayal and it may have hastened his demise.
Tracee was a young dancer who worked at the Bada Bing strip club. Her boss was Silvio Dante, the owner of the Bing, who extended credit to many of his dancers who wished to undergo breast augmentation. Silvio commented that Tracee had a nice body but poor teeth, and Tracee had run up a debt with Silvio for orthodontia to straighten her jagged teeth. Only 20 years old, she already had a son, who was taken by child protective services after she burnt him with cigarettes. She blamed her abusive behavior on a "lot of repressed anger" which could be traced back to her own abusive upbringing. She was dating Ralph Cifaretto and got pregnant with his child. Her theme song at The Bing as a dancer was "Living on a Thin Line" by The Kinks. She drove a motorcycle. At The Bing, Ralph is seen having a threesome with Tracee, performing anal sex on her while she fellates a police officer in a storage closet.
Tracee.
One day at The Bing, Tracee expressed her thanks to Tony by giving him some homemade bread for advising her to take her sick son to the doctor, but Tony firmly reminded her that he was a superior like Silvio. This did not stop Tracee from seeking his advice on whether to have an abortion or to keep the baby. Tony gave his advice, although reluctantly, that taking her age and situation into account and with Ralph as the father, it would be best to get an abortion. Later, Tracee missed work, and Silvio hunted her down to find her waiting on Ralph hand and foot. As Silvio forced her into his car, he slapped her and threatened Tracee, telling her she is forced to be a dancer until the debt for her braces is repaid. Rather than confront Silvio about abusing Tracee, Ralph watched from the window laughing uncontrollably. The following night, Tracee met Ralph at the Bada Bing VIP lounge, where she insulted him in front of the other associates and capos. Ralph followed her out to the deserted parking lot, where he teased her into thinking he would actually marry and support her. He then abruptly changed his tone and gleefully made snide remarks that her daughter would end up as a "cocksucking slob" just like her. Outraged, Tracee slapped him and insulted his masculinity, which led to Ralph brutally beating her to death. When Tony found out about this, he assaulted Ralph, violating a well-established Mafia code according to which made men were never to strike one another. Tony attempted to justify his actions by stating that Ralph "disrespected the Bing". When asked about his opinion on the incident by Tony, Silvio said that Tony would only have been able to physically retaliate if it had involved a mistress or a blood relative, and since Tracee was neither Ralph had a legitimate complaint against Tony and was owed an apology. Although Tony is disappointed that he cannot retaliate against Ralph, Silvio is also angry at Tracee's murder and says some punishment is justified, and tells Tony that Ralph is now banned from the Bada Bing.
Tracee's murder would have some effect on Tony's psyche, as he reports on the depression to Dr. Melfi, but lies that a teenage boy employed with Barone Sanitation died in an accident as Carmela was in joint therapy with him. During Thanksgiving dinner, when Tony sees Meadow in the kitchen, he has a momentary vision of Tracee, arguably as Meadow and Tracee were not that far apart in age. Tony apologizes for the recent rifts between them, and Meadow is more receptive, considering her recent breakup with Noah.
Svetlana Kirilenko (Russian: Светла́на Кириленко) is the maternal cousin of Tony's ex, Irina, and is manager of a home health/nursing business. Irina has stated that she and Svetlana share a sister-like rivalry (e.g., Svetlana has a relatively stable life [a committed boyfriend; a career; self-confident; an independent nature], while Irina's is volatile [a series of temporary and tumultuous romances, no career; low self-esteem; dependent and emotionally fragile]). Svetlana's American fiance, who works for the New York Mets, is named Bill. During her childhood, Svetlana developed an osteosarcoma in her leg, which had to be amputated soon afterward. Svetlana first appears as the last in a series of home health nurses the Sopranos hire to care for Livia Soprano, after her primary caregiver and daughter, Janice, suddenly flees town in the aftermath of Richie Aprile's death. After Livia dies, Tony allows Svetlana to continue living in Livia's house, until she can find her own place to live. However, when Janice resurfaces to lay claim to Livia's house and valuables, Svetlana informs Janice that Livia had given her Livia's prized set of vintage phonograph records—which Janice coveted, and had planned to immediately sell on eBay. When Svetlana declines Janice's repeated requests to give her the records, anyway—alleging that they are "a family heirloom"—Janice vengefully steals and hides Svetlana's prosthetic leg. After Janice feigns ignorance of the leg's whereabouts but hints that the leg could reappear if Svetlana gives her the records, Svetlana sends two Russian mob thugs to attack Janice as payback. The thugs briefly strike Janice, and warn it could get worse if she does not cooperate. Sufficiently intimidated, Janice takes them to a bowling alley, where she surrenders the prosthetic leg, having hidden it in a locker.
Tony Soprano's mistresses.
Svetlana Kirilenko.
Svetlana resurfaces as a temporary replacement for Uncle Junior's nurse, Branca (who works for her), after he suffers a fall at the courthouse. One afternoon while Uncle Junior is asleep, Tony has sex with Svetlana on Junior's sofa; Branca arrives soon after they finish—both clothed, but disheveled, in the middle of a conversation in which Svetlana is trying to tactfully decline Tony's offer to expand their tryst into an ongoing affair. Branca takes in the scene but says nothing, while Svetlana displays a very guilty-looking facial expression. Irina soon finds out about this and informs Carmela about the affair, prompting Carmela's violent confrontation of Tony and their ultimate separation. Svetlana later tells Tony that Branca told Irina about their affair after an argument over Svetlana's withholding Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax and other taxes from her paycheck.
Tony admires Svetlana for her toughness of spirit, intelligence, and refusal to allow her disability and other random misfortunes to get in the way of her ambitions; he also thinks she looks like movie legend Greta Garbo. Svetlana is, arguably, the most (if not, only) psychologically well-adjusted of all Tony's extramarital sex partners.
Valentina lives in Fairfield in Essex County, New Jersey. She was Tony's mistress during seasons 4 and 5. Of Cuban and Italian descent, she was originally Ralph Cifaretto's girlfriend but was drawn to Tony after they met at Hesh's horse stable. Over lunch, she disclosed to Tony Ralph's sexual idiosyncrasies. The following day, Tony and Valentina have passionate sex in a hotel room where Valentina plays pranks on him when their lunch arrives; she begins dating Tony behind Ralph's back. Subsequently, after not being able to bear any more of Ralph's masochistic inclinations, she breaks up with Ralph and begins dating Tony exclusively, which Tony later reveals to Ralph. She believes it is good luck to step in horse manure before a race. As Ralph is rather preoccupied with his son's severe medical condition, he shrugs it off and is seemingly indifferent about it. In the Season Five episode "The Test Dream", after she pushes Tony to make a decision about staying with his wife or being committed to her, her robe catches fire while trying to cook eggs for Tony. Tony quickly extinguishes the fire, but Valentina suffers from second degree burns. Although it is soon discovered that Valentina will fully heal from the wounds and return to her beautiful self, Tony breaks the news to her that he is going back to Carmela.
Irina is Tony's Kazakh mistress during the first two seasons. Tony broke up with Irina because she wanted him to commit to a relationship, but he could not because he was still married with children. Irina then attempted suicide but was found by her cousin, Svetlana. As a sign of friendship and apologies, Tony sent Silvio to tell her to move on with her life and present her with a one-time payoff of $75,000. In Season Four, when Assemblyman Ronald Zellman tells Tony that he has been dating Irina for quite some time, Tony does not care that she is seeing a new man. However, Tony later gets jealous and decides to take matters into his own hands. Tony humiliates Zellman in front of Irina by whipping him with a belt. Svetlana later tells Tony the couple had broken up because after the emasculating attack, Zellman "could not perform." When Uncle Junior's nurse Branca, who works for Svetlana, walks in on Tony and Svetlana just after they had sex, she later tells Irina. Irina calls Tony's house, briefly speaks with AJ, and then tells Carmela that she is Tony's ex-mistress and informs Carmela of Tony's tryst with Svetlana. Carmela warns Irina never to call the house again, but the call prompts Carmela's violent confrontation of Tony and their marital separation. When Tony goes to confront Irina, Svetlana tells him that Irina is most likely hiding in Brighton Beach and reveals that Branca told Irina about their affair after an argument over Svetlana's withholding Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax and other taxes from her paycheck.
Julianna is from Binghamton, New York and her parents own a catering business. She left home at seventeen because she said she didn't want to make Salisbury steak for the next twenty years. She nearly became Tony's new mistress as he recovered from his gunshot in 2006. They met because she was a realtor working for Century 21 and trying to purchase a building owned by Tony (Caputo's Poultry) in Newark, New Jersey. She was persistent in pursuing the deal, contacting Tony at Satriale's and the Bada Bing and over the phone. At the Bada Bing Tony first made a pass at Julianna but she told him she was going to exercise self-control and decline because she was engaged and everything was going well for her. Despite some misgivings eventually, her third offer was high enough for him to accept the deal; Tony arranged to meet her at home to sign the papers. When he arrived, they got business out of the way and immediately started kissing and began to undress one another. When the undressing reminds Tony of Carmela's devotion in taking care of him after his gunshot wound, Tony abruptly ends the encounter and walks out. Tony later spotted Julianna on a ride at the Feast of St. Elzéar but failed to get her attention.
Julianna Skiff.
Following her rejection by Tony, Julianna went to an AA meeting. There, she met Christopher Moltisanti who was also in attendance and who remembered her from when she first approached Tony at Satriale's. He introduced himself after the meeting and invited her for coffee which prompted the beginning of an extramarital affair with Julianna. Tony reinitiated his pursuit of Julianna when they met to close the Caputo's poultry real estate deal and she was initially polite in declining any further contact with him. He arranged to meet with her on the basis of starting another real estate deal and this time she was more angry in rejecting his advances.
Despite warnings from both of their sponsors, (Christopher and Julianna's relationship was enabling for the two recovering addicts) they began smoking heroin together. Christopher revealed to Tony his relationship with Julianna to avoid him investigating for himself and discovering their drug use. After a conversation about Christopher's disappointment with his life in organized crime (because of failure of others to live by the code of omertà), and their return to drug abuse, Julianna worried their relationship was ending and suggested they attend a meeting together. In episode "Kennedy and Heidi," she attended Christopher's wake, encountering Tony and Carmela together as she came to pay her respects, where Tony accidentally introduced her as "Julianna Skiffle".
Gloria Trillo was a 40-year-old car saleswoman for Globe Motors, a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Fairfield, New Jersey. Tony asks his Uncle Junior, remembering back to his childhood if he knew a tradesman or building contractor with the last name Trillo, Junior vaguely remembers a stonemason or a building contractor named Trillo who had seven daughters. It is never revealed if this is the same Trillo family that Gloria is related to. She was also a patient of Dr. Melfi's. She met Tony Soprano at Melfi's office due to a scheduling mix-up; there was an immediate attraction between the two of them and within days they were having an affair. She tells Tony that she had "killed" seven relationships to date. Although she presented the facade of a strong and independent woman, Gloria is in fact mentally unstable and exhibits signs of Borderline Personality Disorder, which led to occasional violent arguments and physical altercations with Tony, bouts of severe depression and frequent suicidal thoughts. One such incident occurs after Gloria sees Tony's wife Carmela at her dealership, getting her car serviced, and offers to drive her home. After another clash, Tony is disgusted to realize Gloria has recognized him as a man capable of violence and is trying to provoke him into killing her as a form of surrogate suicide. Instead, he calls it quits and cuts off all contact with her and orders Patsy Parisi to threaten Gloria into staying away from him. Patsy accomplishes this by posing as a customer at the dealership and going on a test drive with Gloria; when they were out of the city, he pulled a gun on her and told her she would never see or talk to Tony or any of his family again, or "the last face you'll see will be mine, not his. It won't be cinematic." This proves to be too much for unbalanced Gloria, and she resorts to suicide, hanging herself in her home just a few weeks later. Unaware of the relationship, Carmela --Tony's wife--informs Tony of her suicide in bed one night and he feels strong guilt and initially blames Dr. Melfi for Gloria's death, claiming that she did too little to save Gloria, but he also blames himself. Later, he comes to understand that Gloria was beyond salvation, and the relationship was a mistake from the beginning. An ongoing theme in their relationship was Gloria's use of the phrase, "poor you," which reminded Tony of his mother and the toxic relationship he had with her.
"Father Phil" is the priest at the Soprano's local Catholic church. Initially, Intintola and Carmela Soprano have a robust friendship based on a mutual love of romantic and "indie" movies, pseudo-intellectualism, and all things related to Classical European (especially Italian) culture. Tony Soprano finds their intimate friendship—and Father Phil's constant, uninvited visits to their home for Carmela's home-cooked food—threatening and irritating. Tony strongly suspects that Father Phil is in love with Carmela, and using their friendship to seduce her. Carmela denies this, saying she sees Father Phil only as a "spiritual mentor" she utilizes "to become a better Catholic", and, the rare male friend who appreciates things that the ultra-masculine Tony finds to be unmanly. One rainy evening, with Tony and Meadow in Maine and AJ away at a friend's house, Father Phil visits Carmela (who is sick), and the two share ziti and wine together. After lots of wine and watching a movie together, the two come dangerously close to kissing—and beyond—only for the mood and potential infidelity to be shut down by Father Phil's nausea (brought on by drinking too much); he sleeps over without having sex with Carmela, resulting in an awkward feeling between the two, the morning after. Carmela seems wistful and disappointed in Father Phil's inability to act on their mutual attraction in a way that she, as "a good Catholic" will not. Tony later finds out about this, and verbally taunts Father Phil several times. Carmela gets jealous when she makes a surprise, mid-week visit to the church to bring Father Phil a home-cooked specialty—only to see him already being fed a home-cooked dish by her best friend, Rosalie Aprile, and him having the same chemistry with her, that she thought he only had with her. Soon after, Carmela confronts and ends her friendship with Father Phil, accusing him of developing para-romantic relationships with women parishioners to gain gifts and other favors. After this, Father Phil is usually seen in the series celebrating Mass (particularly funerals), as a general attendee at Soprano family functions, and at charity functions coordinated by Carmela. Although Father Phil was mostly seen ministering to female parishioners, he also counseled men (e.g., he repeatedly invited Tony to attend church and confession more often, in order to reduce his anxiety attacks by improving his relationship with God, and turning away from the 'unrighteous path' of his 'business' activities). Another noted scene with Father Phil was when he counseled Ralph Cifaretto when "Ralphie" came to him devastated and perplexed by his teen son's life-threatening injury (after random, household play with a friend). Father Phil encourages Ralph to view the tragedy as an opportunity to change his life's course; he also gently rejects Ralph's assertion that God caused/allowed his son to be injured in order to punish Ralph for his criminal sins. Later in the series, Carmela confesses her adultery to Father Phil, who is disappointed and points out that although Tony is an adulterer as well, "two wrongs do not make a right". He orders Carmela to do a penance by way of doing something nice for Tony, which she later does. When Tony was comatose after being shot, Carmela was again dependent on Father Phil, as he is seen comforting her and the Soprano children who are at Tony's hospital bed.
Vic is a certified home contractor whom Carmela Soprano hired to wallpaper the dining room in her home. He is also the brother-in-law of David Scatino, the brother of Dave's wife Christine. He is a widower, his wife was a gourmet cook and died of breast cancer. They did not have children because Christine had problems with her womb. Carmela and Vic once kissed in the powder room Carmela is considering renovating and later made plans for a gourmet lunch date to be prepared by Carmela for Vic's next visit. However, after Vic discovers that Tony has taken over David's sporting goods store as a result of David's gambling addiction (which has subsequently left David bankrupt), Vic cancels his lunch date with Carmela by sending his assistant, Ramon, in his place to complete the redecoration while he finishes a job in Wyckoff, New Jersey. Vic is also seen meeting David Scatino at a bar. At first Vic tries to be supportive of David's problems, but after David badmouths his wife/Vic's sister Christine, Vic loses patience, ordering David to move away and to stay away from Vic's sister at all times; Vic also pledges to pay for Eric Scatino's college education, as David has also gambled away his son's college fund. Carmela and Vic later have an awkward meeting in a paint shop, but part on good terms as Carmela thanks Vic for assigning Ramon to finish her house, as she would have been too tempted to commit adultery, and Vic was being strong for the both of them.
Robert Wegler had a relationship with Carmela Soprano while she was separated from her husband Tony. He was AJ's high school guidance counselor and they met through this relationship. It also proved to be their downfall as Wegler felt that Carmela was sexually manipulating him to improve AJ's college prospects. While having other close calls, Wegler was the only man that Carmela committed adultery with during the run of the series. He assigns AJ to read Death in Venice and Billy Budd for book reports and does very well impressing Tony. Meadow Soprano recognizes the signs of her mother and tells her suspicions to AJ, who does not believe her.
Rocco Alatore appears in flashbacks to Tony's childhood. Rocco Alatore was a neighbor to the Soprano family in the Ironbound neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey. Tony once witnessed his father and Junior attack Rocco over a debt, then recalled his father discussing a possible move to Reno, Nevada in 1967 to manage a supper club for Alatore (now on good terms with Johnny since the debt was repaid) and his mother refusing, a move that Livia would later sweep under the rug when Alatore became a billionaire with his investments.
Boyfriend of Janice Soprano in 2001. Aaron was devout evangelical Christian which suited Janice's religious choice of the day (and would occasionally irritate Tony). They tried to make Christian rock music together. Aaron was also narcoleptic, causing him to fall asleep at inopportune times. He was also an occasional Sunday dinner guest at the Soprano residence, which he attended with Janice. He later appeared at the hospital while Tony recovered from his coma, protesting at a "right to life" protest rally.
A young Asian-American patient at Junior Soprano's mental institution who becomes friends with and somewhat of an aide to Junior during his stay there. Carter helps Junior organize a card game between patients, aids him in writing a letter to Dick Cheney and provides diversions for him to avoid taking his prescription drugs. He is intelligent (a visitor references his time at M.I.T. and he once mentions being at the top of his class), but has serious anger management issues. He looks up to Junior Soprano as a role model and seems highly impressed by his authority and ability to influence and control other patients, all much to the disappointment of his visiting mother, who asks him to stay away from "that gangster." Eventually, after Corrado comes to terms with his ailments and starts taking his medication, Carter becomes disillusioned and angry at Junior for this sign of defeat and betrayal to him, and gives him a beating.
Soprano family friends.
Carter Chong.
Carter's father is implied to have been very demanding of him, worked on Wall Street and was at one time subjected to news reports accusing him of something.
Dr. Cusamano's wife who is a stay-at-home mom. Friend of Carmela, but embarrassed and intimidated by the Soprano family's mafia connections. In "I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano", Tony told Dr. Melfi he had fantasized about Jeannie during a dream. In the same scene Dr. Melfi seems to indicate she is acquainted with the Cusamanos. Jeannie's twin sister, Joan (also played by Saundra Santiago), was harassed into writing a recommendation letter for Meadow's college application by Carmela in "Full Leather Jacket", although it's never made clear if she actually wrote the letter, or if Jeannie told Carmela it was written just to appease her.
She is described by Tony Soprano as the "best friend" of his mother Livia Soprano from when she was married to "Johnny Boy" Soprano and was a regular attendee with Livia to Anthony Soprano, Jr.'s birthday parties. Fanny cannot drive due to physical ailments brought on by her age and relies on Livia to drive her around. Livia accidentally hits her with her 1963 Oldsmobile 88 after driving her home, breaking her hip. Despite this, Fanny was one of the few people with something nice to say about Livia at her wake - that she always kept her informed when someone died.
Tony accidentally meets Fran at his parents grave-site. Based on John F. Kennedy's mistress Judith Exner and extremely attractive in her youth, she was the longtime mistress of Tony's father, "Johnny Boy" Soprano, until his death in 1986. She worked as a saleslady in the fur department at Bamberger's, and is now losing her hearing, but admits she is too vain for a hearing aid. She recalls meeting Tony once, as a child. Tony's father even confided in Fran about the deleterious verbal abuse that Livia put him and their children through. Ironically, she was on a date with Corrado Soprano at the 500 Club when she first met Johny. Corrado was also in love with Fran and wanted to propose, even buying a ring for her, but could not allow this marriage to affect his status in organized crime, and so could not bring up the courage to ask her. Tony learns that Livia forced his dad to give away his childhood dog, Tippy; it went to Fran and her son Bruce who is working for Israel's national airline El Al). She was briefly involved with President John F. Kennedy and allegedly had sex with him in the Oval Office. Tony secures her promised sale-share in a midget-car racetrack, which was co-owned by "Johnny Boy" with Hesh Rabkin and Phil Leotardo. While Tony originally enjoys her company, his fondness begins to wear thin, as she spends money, given to her by Tony, on expensive shoes rather than utilities, and then revels that she continued to smoke around his father, even after his emphysema. Tony learns that his dad was with Fran on the night Livia was hospitalized for a miscarriage. Tony was even forced to lie to Livia, at the hospital, about his dad's "attendance" at a Yankee's game; this situation caused Tony much confusion and emotional trauma in his youth, and Fran is not seen for the remainder of the series.
Dov Ginsberg is one of Tony's financial advisors although as mentioned by Carmela, Ginsberg is actually a CPA. In the episode Everybody Hurts, Carmela's cousin Brian Cammarata, a finance expert, was advising Tony and Carmela about some finance planning but Tony decided to have a second opinion with Ginsberg which Brian fully approved. Later on at the horse track Ginsberg met with Tony and told him that the life insurance that Brian advised him was irrevocable and will only benefit Carmela when he dies. Ginsberg also told Tony that a life trust could be an alternative for him.
George is the father of AJ Soprano's one time friend, Jeremy Piocosta and an acquaintance of Tony Soprano. When AJ and Jeremy fight in school in 1999, Tony pays a visit to the Piocostas to get to the bottom of it. Although Tony is civil, and even clearly states that A.J. has a history of unruly behavior and may have instigated the fight, George becomes afraid that Tony will seek revenge and avoids contact with him. In 2001, George seems to have overcome his worries as he watches AJ's high school football game alongside Tony.
Roberta was a long-term friend/mistress of Junior Soprano. He often took her down to Boca Raton, Florida on weekends and had set her up with an office job with the pipe-fitter's union. Roberta and Junior's relationship ended in 1999 when Tony got word from Carmela that his uncle performed cunnilingus on Bobbi, and Tony then made taunting references to this at a golf game. Bobbi had started the rumor herself by discussing her sex life at a nail parlor also frequented by Gaby Dante. Junior had warned Bobbi never to talk about this aspect of their relationship because it would cost him respect. Realizing that she had ignored his wishes, Junior stormed into her office and ended their sixteen-year relationship. Junior was so furious that Bobbi was afraid he would harm her, but in the end, he just fired her and smushed a lemon meringue pie in her face. In the following season, after Junior's release from prison into house arrest, he asks Bobby Baccala whether any of his acquaintances have called to express sympathy or concern, and specifically asks about Bobbi Sanfillipo. Baccala tells Junior that Sanfillipo has married and moved away.
Owner of Satriale's Pork Store. We only see Francis in a flashback. He is a wholesaler who sells a variety of meat products. He is a successful independent neighborhood businessman who is familiar with the ways of the Mafia and is well liked and known in the neighborhood. Johnny Boy had known Francis for a long time and had been a regular guest at his house. Apparently, he owed Johnny Boy Soprano a sufficient amount of money which he had received through Johnny Boy's loanshark operation. Johnny Boy informs him that he had been avoiding a meeting with him to discuss his overdue debt. Tony, as a youth, followed his dad to the pork store without his dad knowing. During one of Johnny Boy's final visits with Francis, he attempts to barter with Soprano by informing him of all the fine meats he had given Livia recently free of charge for compensation. Johnny Boy becomes enraged at Francis trying to barter his way out of his debt with the meat deliveries. There, Johnny Boy chopped off Francis' pinky with a cleaver. He half-heartedly apologizes to Francis in having been forced to inflict punishment upon him. In a later episode, "...To Save Us All From Satan's Power", Paulie mentions that Francis committed suicide with a gun. It is suspected that Francis committed suicide having been faced with being murdered over his large debt to Johnny Boy. Johnny Boy later is suspected of acquiring the business and therefore ultimately clearing his family of the debt brought upon them.
David "Davey" Scatino is a childhood friend of Tony Soprano and Artie Bucco. He is often called Davey. He owns the local sporting goods store (Ramsey Sports and Outdoors) and his son, Eric, was a good friend of Meadow. Reluctantly, Tony allowed David to participate in a high-stakes poker game with full knowledge that he did not have the financial assets or poker savvy to win or break even. David quickly became heavily indebted to Tony. Tony took over his business, and took David's son's car as a down payment. The car was given to Meadow, but she quickly rejected it when she realized it once belonged to her friend. Having lost his life savings, his business, his son's college fund to Georgetown University, the respect of his family, and his wife (who divorced him), he decided to move out west to work on a ranch near Las Vegas.
David Scatino.
In the Season 3 episode, "The Telltale Moozadell", Meadow informs Tony that David later went into a mental facility in Nevada, after a breakdown. Tony told David that he had subconsciously planned to profit from David's gambling habit, in accordance with his "predatory" nature. Tony later took offense when his other high school friend, Artie Bucco, became similarly indebted and suggested exactly the same thing, after Artie had attempted to commit suicide.
Yale is a hacky, untalented comedian whose act isn't well received. As part of his act he does impressions of Ed Sullivan and Bob Dylan. He is seen at Green Grove attempting to entertain the seniors, though none of them are listening, and also at The Bada Bing, which ends with his getting booed off the stage.
Rosalie Aprile's daughter. Kelli attended the funeral of her brother, Jackie Aprile, Jr. and suggested that the mafia was responsible for his death. Meadow Soprano chastised her for speaking of their family connections in front of an outsider and suggested that Kelli lacked loyalty.
Karen was Bobby Baccalieri's wife until her death in a car accident in 2002. They had two children, Bobby III and Sophia. Karen was friends with Carmela Soprano, Rosalie Aprile and Gabriella Dante and attended church functions with them. Bobby kept Karen's last baked ziti in the freezer for a long time following her death as he didn't feel ready to eat it. In the episode Calling All Cars, Janice Soprano becomes Bobby's girlfriend and Bobby finally feels comfortable enough to let Janice reheat the ziti, as they eat, the ghost of Karen pays a visit by subtly moving Janice's wine glass.
Son of Bobby Bacala and Karen Baccalieri, brother of Sophia Baccalieri. He is referred to as "Bobby Jr." although his father is actually the second "Bobby". Bobby Jr.'s mother died in a car accident in 2002. He was often the victim of bullying from A.J. Soprano. After Bobby Jr.'s mother died, his father married Janice Soprano, who became Bobby's stepmother. Bobby Jr. was involved in the ride malfunction at the 2006 Feast of St. Elzear festival. His relationship with his father became more distant in his teenage years and he refused to play with his father's trainset and watch a Giants game with his father. Janice continues to use her manipulative skills with Bobby Jr. She controls his behavior by threatening him with a public reading of a report card to keep him home for Sunday dinner and to do his homework. Bobby Jr. cited A.J.'s behavior as a reason why he should be able to avoid family engagements. He was a fan of Massive Genius and likes the San Diego Chargers despite his father being a New York Giants fan.
Daughter of Bobby and Karen Baccalieri, sister of Bobby Baccalieri III. Sophia's mother died in a car accident in 2002. Sophia's father later remarried and Janice Soprano became Sophia's stepmother. Sophia played soccer in school and Janice once got into a headline making altercation with another soccer mom at one of Sophia's games. In the series finale "Made in America," now after the death of her father, it is revealed Sophia and her brother wished to live with their grandmother, which upsets Janice because she felt Dominica (Janice's daughter, Sophia's half-sister) was "very much into her older sister." Janice then describes to Tony that her and Sophia "actually have a bond" when Janice expressed she wanted to live with her stepchildren. Whether or not Sophia and her brother became close to Janice is unclear; Janice is known for lying and judging from past episodes, Bobby's kids have always shown great contempt towards Janice.
Tony Blundetto's identical twin sons who spent time with him between his release from prison and death in 2004. Their father's sperm was smuggled out of United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners to impregnate his (now divorced) wife. In real life, in 2000, several mob associates at Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood were convicted of smuggling sperm out of prison for exactly the same reason.
Tony Blundetto's estranged daughter, who lived with the Sopranos for an undisclosed period of time prior to the show. Tony Soprano told John Sacrimoni that he had spent the evening with Tony B. searching for her in Monticello, New York after she had allegedly disappeared again and was homeless and living with a crack cocaine addict. The grandmother has not seen her since Tony B.'s divorce following his incarceration. In one of the photographs at her grandmother's house, she is wearing an anarchist T-shirt. Kelly and Meadow attended school together briefly, although this is never discussed in the series and none of Meadow's friends ever mention her. The story was to provide him with an alibi for the killing of Joe Peeps. When Tony B. asks Meadow how his daughter did in school she replied "Straight A's".

Angie Bonpensiero is the wife of Sal "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero. They have three children, including sons Kevin and Matt, at college age in 2000, and daughter Terri, who was married and trying to conceive with her husband in 2000. Angie was unaware of her husband's status as an FBI informant. His disappearance when he was afraid his friends were on to him and subsequent erratic behavior created problems for their relationship. When she and Pussy were having marital problems, Angie considered suicide and divorce. She discussed this with her horrified friends Gabriella Dante, Rosalie Aprile and Carmela Soprano over lunch. She also revealed that she had been unwell since Pussy's return and had been investigated for cancer. Pussy had remained indifferent to her health problems and seemed more concerned about spraying WD-40 on his pocket knife. At Carmela's urging to stay true to her Catholic faith, Angie decided to move into a separate bedroom rather than end their marriage. Later, when Pussy arrives home and silently presents flowers to Angie, she smiles for a moment but then swats him with them.
Soprano crime family relations.
Angie Bonpensiero.
In 2001, after Pussy "disappeared" for good, Angie believed that he had left her and decided to move on with her life. Tony continued to compensate Angie in her husband's absence - she used the money to buy a fancy new Cadillac but still complained to Carmela about her strained finances. As punishment, Tony damaged the car and took away her allowance. Soon, Carmela finds Angie giving out free samples at the local Pathmark and they lost contact. This likely moved Tony to forgive Angie, as he has since made her the manager of Pussy's body shop. After a long period of time without talking, she and Carmela decide to end their quarrel and go out to dinner where they both show off their new cars, with Angie showing how successful she has become running Pussy's Auto Body by buying a new Chevrolet Corvette. Shortly after the reconciliation Carmela learns that Angie is putting money out on the street via Patsy Parisi and Benny Fazio for shylocking and they are using their connections to help her with the body shop.
Duke is Salvatore Bonpensiero's brother and a co-owner of the Body Shop. He runs the body shop alongside Angie Bonpensiero and helps repair Phil Leotardo's car. Edward is later extorted by Phil for his car repairs by refurnishing the Lincoln Town Car with an expensive front bench seat and brand new radio.
Kevin was one of Salvatore and Angie Bonpensiero's children. He was enrolled in a business program at Villanova University in 1999 and visited home when suspicion of his father being a rat prompted Tony Soprano to visit it as well.
Matt is Salvatore and Angie Bonpensiero's youngest child. He was enrolled in college in 2000 and visited home and played baseball at the batting cages with his father and A.J. He also talked philosophy with A.J. Soprano, offering to help out his father when A.J. first tried to relate Friedrich Nietzsche to Big Pussy. His father, who never enrolled in any philosophy classes, was at a loss until Matt told his father he better understood and would speak to A.J. about his concerns. He later broke up his parents fighting and got them back together.
Terri is never seen, though she is Big Pussy's and Angie's oldest child and only daughter. It's mentioned she is attending Villanova University as well as her brother. She is married and has had difficulty conceiving a child. She is perhaps the same person as the Terri that is shown as a friend of Adriana La Cerva who helps her chose a wedding dress as well as tells her that a wife may be called on to testify against her husband ("Watching Too Much Television").
Gigi Cestone's wife. Tony Soprano offers his condolences to her at her husband's funeral. She did not know about her husband's gastrointestinal and heart condition that was helped brought on by the stress of dealing with Ralph Cifaretto as part of his crew, which Tony Soprano and others are told caused his heart attack. She is the mother of two children with Gigi that are never seen but are said by Gigi to be getting ready to go to college. She cooks Gigi and her children a huge Thanksgiving dinner and while Gigi likes her cooking, the amount of turkey and other food from the feast bothers his stomach for days afterwards, making Gigi comment, "It's like spackle on my bowels."
Justin's parents are divorced and his mother has since remarried. Ralph had very little to do with his son growing up and only saw him on weekends. He considers his ex-wife "a psychotic bitch."

Ralph Cifaretto's son who impales himself while playing with a bow and arrow with a friend while Ralph is in the bathtub. Ralph became very distraught over his son's serious injury, one of the few times he actually shows his true emotions to his criminal associates. He was injured while playing an archery game from J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of The Rings". Even with his son hospitalized and in the emergency ward recovering from the injury, Ralph still produced more illicit funds from his criminal enterprising than the rest of the Soprano crew. Ralph later tells Tony that he was in Florida for Justin's seventh birthday and was so high on cocaine that he forgot to call him and actually thought he did. Although Ralph has not been to church in a long time he did take Justin to have him baptized. Ralph may also have arranged to have the stables which held his and Tony's prized racehorse Pie-O-My set ablaze to pay for his son's overwhelming hospital bills, although Ralph denies this when Tony confronts him. It could be said that his son Justin's accident led to Ralph's death as Tony strangles him to death following an argument about the fire. Justin does not fully recover from the hospital before his father's murder and subsequent disappearance. When Tony visits Ralph after the stable fire though, Ralph mentions that only Justin's speech will be affected and that he'll have to learn to talk all over again.
Gabriella is the wife of longtime Soprano family soldier and consigliere Silvio Dante. They have a daughter, Heather Dante, who played volleyball and soccer with Meadow Soprano. She is close friends with Rosalie Aprile and Carmela Soprano and can often be seen dining out with them, typically at "Nuovo Vesuvio".

In 2006 when Tony was shot, Silvio became acting boss of the family. Gabriella was supportive of her husband in this role and ambitious enough to encourage him to consider the possibility of it long term. Silvio revealed that Jackie Aprile had considered him to take over when he was diagnosed with cancer but that Silvio had decided it wasn't for him, and encouraged him to pick Tony instead.
Gabriella attended Allegra Sacrimoni's wedding with her husband and continued to support Ginny Sacrimoni including attending her 50th birthday party at her home. She attended Christopher Moltisanti's funeral. She is last seen attending to her husband (by filing his toe nails) in the hospital, as he lies in a coma after being shot by gunmen sent from New York.

Right, Ben".
Jason is the son of Soprano capo Carlo Gervasi. He is seen in the second half of Season Six participating in a sports gambling ring at Rutgers University, along with Patsy Parisi's youngest son, also named Jason. There is never any indication of who his mother is or what happened to Carlo's wife "Barbara". When discussing AJ's suicide attempt Carlo thinks that Jason has occasional bouts of depression but does not really understand why. He displays violent tendencies common to violent psychopath behaviour displayed by Richie Aprile and Ralph Cifaretto, including torturing a welching gambler and beating a Somali cyclist. Throughout the series it seems Carlo has little to do with his son's life and does not discipline him. His behavior is initially admired but later seems repulsive to A.J. Soprano. In the series finale, Jason is arrested for selling drugs, forcing his father to turn against Tony Soprano and cut a deal with the FBI.
"Nucci" is introduced as Paulie Gualtieri's elderly mother who is very nervous and protective of her son. When Paulie was younger, Nucci was always there to bail him out of jail and to defend him from the neighbors. After Tony had placed his own mother in the Green Grove Nursing Home, Paulie followed his lead and found Nucci a spot and she soon moved in. Unlike Tony's mother though, Nucci was grateful for Paulie for doing this for her. However, her old friends, Cookie Cirillo and Minn Matrone were far from friendly and tried to exclude her from social activities. To avenge his mother's honor, Paulie sent Benny and her grandson Little Paulie to badly beat Cookie's son, after which the two were forced to include her. Paulie later murdered Minn Matrone for her money. Nucci played an active role in getting Paulie to help Sal Vitro reclaim his landscaping business when Feech La Manna's nephew stole all of his customers.
Marianucci Gualtieri.
Paulie learns from his Aunt Dottie's deathbed that she is his mother and that Nucci adopted her nephew as her child. When Paulie hears this, he cuts off all contact with both of them, refusing to attend Dottie's funeral or pay for Nucci's accommodation at Green Grove. Nucci and Paulie reconnected at the Feast of St. Elzear festival - Nucci criticized Paulie for his involvement in organizing the festival as a ride malfunction had injured several children. Later, Paulie visited her at Green Grove (now paid for by her biological son) and they had a silent reconciliation. In episode "Kennedy and Heidi," she died of natural causes, however her funeral was poorly attended, as a majority of the people went to Christopher Moltisanti's funeral, much to Paulie's ire as he felt Christopher always out-shined him in life, and even manages it in death.
Minn was a friend of Nucci Gualtieri. Minn and her friend, Cookie Cirillo, didn't like Nucci very much, which Paulie resented. Her husband Salvatore was a barber accessories salesman for 46 years and attended the theatre every week. Minn is a fan of Stephen Sondheim. Minn was angry at Nucci when Nucci caused a car accident for the three friends while Minn was driving. She doesn't live at Green Grove but visits Cookie and the others, preparing to enter the facility after her hip surgery. Cookie mentioned that Minn kept her life savings under her mattress. Paulie heard this, and broke into Minn's house late that night. Paulie was looking for the money under her bed, but Minn caught him. Minn threatened to call "his mother" (Nucci), but he hung up the phone, trying to play it off as a misunderstanding. Minn saw through his act and kneed Paulie in the groin, and ran out of the bedroom screaming for help, but was chased down by Paulie in the hallway. Paulie threw Minn on the ground, and suffocated her with a small pillow. He left her dead body on the floor as he took the money.
JoJo was the wife of Mikey Palmice - a soldier in Junior's crew and consigliere to Junior when he became boss. JoJo is a short form for the names Joanna, Joanne, Jody and Josephine although it is never known what her true name is because that is all Mikey refers to her as. She, like many other "mob wives", is aware of her husband's lifestyle. They have a turbulent relationship which is shown when her husband brings home a stolen food processor, and she comments "yay, another kitchen appliance". She fulfills the role of a subordinate housewife and is widely ignored, neglected and verbally abused by her husband, although it is never shown if Palmice physically harms her. It is suggested that she suffers from mental anguish or depression brought on by her husband's belittling behavior. However, as his wife she still loved him. Mikey was killed while out jogging, for attempting to kill Tony, leaving JoJo a widow. She appeared in the episode "Pie-O-My" after the death of the wife of Bobby Baccalieri, Karen. JoJo had brought food for Bobby to show her support at a difficult time. She had moved on from then. Janice Soprano had romantic ideas for Bobby and sensed a potential rival in JoJo so she took the meal to Junior's house to conceal it from Bobby, saying she made it herself.
JoJo Palmice.
She also has two children with Mikey, Michael Palmice Jr. and Francis Albert Palmice.
Donna is the wife of longtime Soprano soldier Pasquale "Patsy" Parisi and sister-in-law to Phillip Parisi. She is occasionally seen accompanying him at family functions such as Furio Giunta's housewarming and Tony Blundetto's welcome home party. She very infrequently socializes with the other mob wives and does not appear to be part of Carmela's inner circle. In the series finale, "Made in America," however, she is invited to the Soprano home with her husband to spend time and talk there due to Meadow Soprano now being engaged to be married to her older son Patrick.
It appeared in Season 6B that Jason Parisi, along with Jason Gervasi are associates of the DiMeo Crime Family. Jason is the younger son of Donna and Patsy Parisi and nephew of Phillip "Philly Spoons" Parisi. He is seen in the second half of Season 6, participating in an elusive professional sportsbook gambling ring at a coffee house in Rutgers University, along with Carlo Gervasi's son, also named Jason. Following AJ's attempted suicide Patsy Parisi reveals that Jason suffers from Attention deficit disorder. At Bobby Baccalieri's wake, when AJ Soprano makes a speech about society he suggests that he and AJ team up and go kill some terrorists. He displays violent tendencies common to mobsters, including torturing a welching gambler and beating a Somalian bicyclist. His behavior is initially admired, but later repulsive to A.J. Soprano. According to Patsy, Jason is a computer whiz and he built a website for his mother.
Patrick is the son of Roberta Feliciano and Patsy Parisi, and the older brother of Jason Parisi. He is the nephew of Phillip Parisi. He is mentioned only in passing, but it is revealed that Patrick was Meadow Soprano's recurring "mystery date", and that the two have been dating since the premiere of "Cleaver". Tony and Carmela both have reservations about Patrick for reasons that are not disclosed, to which Meadow responds that he has changed. It is implied that he is studying or practicing law. In the series finale, Meadow announces her engagement to Patrick. Tony suggests that he have a frat party for himself and his friends at the Bada Bing and that he invite AJ. When he hears news about AJ's separation with his girlfriend he is pleased saying, "I'm glad he switched back over to the other side."
Deanna and Eugene Pontecorvo's daughter. Younger sister of Robby Pontecorvo. Eugene took Ally to Florida with the rest of his family on vacation when they were younger.
Eugene Pontecorvo's wife until his suicide in 2006. Deanna was eager to take the inheritance they received from the death of Gene's aunt and move to Florida. Her husband was unable to achieve this because his boss Tony Soprano refused his retirement request—as did the FBI. Deanna was frustrated with Gene's lack of progress with his work and not afraid to tell him so, contributing to his suicide.
Deanne and Eugene Pontecorvo's son. He is the older brother of Ally Pontecorvo. Robert had a growing drug addiction which adds turmoil between him and his father. The drug addiction contributed as one of the major factors to his suicide.
Francesa Spatafore is the daughter of Vito Spatafore and Marie Spatafore and the younger sister of Vito Spatafore, Jr. Francesa and Vito Jr. become estranged from each other after Tony Soprano has Vito Jr. sent off to boot camp in Idaho.
Marie Spatafore is the wife of Vito Spatafore and mother of their two children Vito, Jr. and Francesca who live in Belleville, New Jersey. She is also a cousin of Phil Leotardo and a friend to his wife - the two families eat dinner together. Marie accompanied Vito to the wedding of Allegra Sacrimoni. They left early and Marie remarked that Vito often behaved oddly at weddings. Despite his claims to be ill, she is not very surprised when he goes out later that night telling her he needs to make collections.
Marie Spatafore.
Marie is loyal to her husband despite his homosexuality. When the crew are looking for Vito, Marie is visited by Silvio who quizzes her about their sex life, which she refuses to discuss, but seemingly confirms by her silence. She attended Phil's grandson's confirmation dinner despite the rumors about her husband. Phil himself is supportive of Marie but he discusses the need to find Vito with her. She tells Phil that Vito is a good father and a loving husband and she hopes that he will not be cast aside after his years of loyal service.
Marie does not seem to have a close relationship with Carmela or the other Soprano family mob wives - although Carmela referred to her as a "smart" woman when she found out about Vito - implying that Marie must have known about his homosexuality. Carmela wonders whether they had an arrangement.
When Vito phoned home from the road, Marie was not hostile towards him and, when he later returned to New Jersey after months of absence, she allowed him to see the children and seemed to consider his reconciliation overtures. When Vito was killed, Marie, now widow, was distraught again, insisting to Phil that Vito was a good father and a good man.
In 2007, her son Vito Jr. was seriously misbehaving, becoming a disturbing Goth delinquent, and Marie pleaded for Tony's financial aid to relocate their family to Maine to escape the judging neighborhood (condemning the family for Vito's sexuality), which she believed brought on his misconduct. When Tony was only able to scrape up money for a boot camp in Idaho (reportedly allowing corporal punishment against children), Marie had to painfully and tearfully accept the offer and let her son be forcefully taken to the camp by its agents.
Vito Spatafore, Jr. is the son of Vito Spatafore and Marie Spatafore and the older brother of Francesca Spatafore. At a confirmation dinner for Phil Leotardo's grandson, Vito was teased by other children about his father's rumored homosexuality. When Vito Sr. called home from lamming it to avoid the consequences of being outed, he had a difficult conversation with his young son and asked him to look after his mother. He likes sports and is a fan of Vince Carter and the Miami Dolphins.
Vito Spatafore, Jr..
After the death of his father, Vito became increasingly isolated and hostile, and started to dress and hang around with kids in the Gothic subculture. He frequently ran away from school, vandalized property and was expelled after defecating in the shower of his high school locker room. Both Tony and Phil sat down with Vito trying to set him straight, but he continued to act out. At wits end with her son's behavior his mother approached Tony asking for financial help to move to a new house in Maine so Vito Jr. could get a fresh start, but Tony, at that point deep in debt from gambling losses, pushed her into the cheaper alternative: a boot camp for delinquents in Idaho. Vito Jr. is last seen being forced out of his house by members of the boot camp in the middle of the night, who are going to transport him to the training camp in the West. As Vito Jr. is kicking and screaming he yells for his mom, who says this is for his own good, and cries out to him she loves him.
MacKenzie Trucillo is the cousin of Kelli Aprile and Jackie Aprile Jr. It is not known whether she is a maternal or a paternal relative to the Aprile family.
Jim Witowski (also known as "Johnny Cakes") was Vito Spatafore's Polish-American gay lover and volunteer firefighter and local hero. Vito met Jim in New Hampshire after Vito fled New Jersey. Jim owned a diner in the New Hampshire town where Vito was staying and Vito was a frequent customer. While putting out a fire, he is seen running into a burning house and rescuing a small child, in which he receives applause when he takes the child to safety. Vito and Jim soon formed an attraction, though the two got into a fistfight outside a bar when Jim tried to kiss Vito and, still in denial about his homosexuality, Vito violently rebuffed him. Jim won the fight decisively. The two soon reconciled and Vito became Jim's live-in lover. Jim even professed his love for Vito one evening, and the pleasantry was returned by Vito to "Johnny Cakes". The pair enjoyed romantic dinners, and Vito buys a chopper motorcycle going on long motorcycle rides, and picnicking lakeside. Ultimately, Vito missed his family and fast-paced lifestyle back in New Jersey too much to stay with Jim. Vito left Jim's house early one morning to return to New Jersey while Jim was still asleep. Vito would later call Jim, but Jim was still angry over the way Vito had left and wanted nothing more to do with him. Vito was violently murdered soon thereafter.
Jim "Johnny Cakes" Witowski.
Jim's nickname, Johnny Cakes, derives from a dish that he recommended to Vito when Vito initially came to his diner.
Johnny Sack's son-in-law who feels intimidated by Johnny's mob leader reputation. Johnny insisted Eric call him "Dad" and paid for the lavish wedding of Eric and his daughter, Allegra.

Patricia or Patty as everyone calls her is the wife of Lupertazzi crime family acting boss Phil Leotardo. Patty and Phil attended Allegra Sacrimoni's wedding together in 2006. Patty is friends with Marie Spatafore and the two families eat dinner together. Patty was also seen at the confirmation dinner of her grandson held at Da Giovanni. Patty was a factor in Phil's decision to kill Vito Spatafore after they discovered he was homosexual - she told Phil that Vito had to be made to face his "sin." She offered little consolation to Marie at Vito's wake and was more upset about her tailor losing his sight. Patty accompanied Phil to the hospital when he first had worries about his heart and rushed him there when his heart attack occurred. She was at his bedside when Tony Soprano came to visit him. Patty was in the driver's seat when Phil was shot dead outside their car at a gas station in the series finale. After he's shot, she rushes out the door with car still in 'drive', and the doors locked, resulting in Phil's head being run over by the car.

She is later terrified when her husband's boat is sunk right outside their home during the turf war with Johnny Sack. Her husband confides to Tony Soprano that Nicole had convinced him to exit the deadly turf war with Johnny Sack, as it was too dangerous and she did not want to become a "the richest widow on Long Island". Carmine also shared with Tony that he and Nicole had had domestic problems that they resolved with the help of marital counseling. She travelled with Carmine to France for a vacation and saw Nicolas Fouquet's Vaux-le-Vicomte chateau.

Johnny Sack's Jewish lawyer. He first tells John that he and his firm does not represent turncoats. John tells him that if his law firm represented turncoats then he would lose all his customers. He advised John to cooperate to avoid a life sentence, to which John rejected by saying that a rat-mobster is like being a Nazi to Ron's people. Ron later tries to come to an agreement with the prosecutor, to which she replies, "Get back to me when you're sober, Ron." John and Ron make a plea agreement for several millions in assets and fifteen-years in exchange for John's allocution, to which Ron encourages John to take saying, "You're still a young man. In fifteen years you'll be sixty-seven. The golden years."
Johnny and Ginny Sack's daughter. During the series run she became a registered nurse, and Tony is seen giving her an envelope of cash as a present for graduating from nursing school. Johnny paid for her lavish wedding to Eric DeBenedetto while Johnny was in prison awaiting trial. Johnny was released to attend the wedding and Allegra was ecstatic that her father would be in attendance, but the judge's conditions meant that Allegra had to put up with metal detectors and US Marshals at the ceremony and reception. Her reception ended on a low-note with her departing limousine being blocked in by the Marshals' SUV's, her father breaking down in tears as he was forcibly led away in handcuffs, and her mother fainting in the crowd. As soon as Ginny fainted, Allegra rushed to her mother's side to check her well-being. She attended her father's trial for racketeering and was present when he was convicted. Ginny described difficulties in her relationship with Allegra to friends - she knew that Allegra felt Ginny was not happy for her and acknowledged it was difficult for Allegra to visit the house with her father imprisoned. Allegra was at her father's side, along with her mother and older sister, when he died of lung cancer in a prison hospital.
Johnny Sack's daughter. Catherine complains that her family always talks about food and is at odds with her mother and sister in terms of appearance; Catherine looks almost underweight, whereas her mother is extremely obese and her sister is overweight. Catherine attended her father's trial for racketeering and was at her father's side, along with her mother and sister, when he died of lung cancer in the prison hospital.
Also known as Ginny Sack, she is the wife of John "Johnny Sack" Sacrimoni and the mother of Catherine and Allegra Marie Sacrimoni. Once a slender professional dancer, Ginny has struggled with her weight since having children. John's love for her seems genuine and blind to her size. In fact, he likes her as she is, "Rubenesque" as he described her, although she is much heavier than the term "Rubenesque" implies. Ginny's ample figure is the subject of numerous jokes by members of the Soprano crime family, and this leads to a serious dispute between her husband and Ralph Cifaretto. Johnny is willing to kill to defend her honor and viciously attacks a member of Ralph's crew, who Johnny mistakenly believes was telling jokes at Ginny's expense. John sometimes becomes angry with Ginny, particularly when she lies to him (as when he once found her sneak-eating hidden candy) but he is usually quick to forgive her. John's discovery of Ginny's secretive binge-eating made him realize he was too hard on the guys who made the joke about his wife.
Ginny Sacrimoni.
Ginny was proud to attend her daughter Allegra's wedding and ecstatic when Johnny was allowed to attend, despite being in prison awaiting trial. Her day ended on a low note when US Marshals blocked her daughter's departure and dragged her sobbing husband off in handcuffs. This proved too much for Ginny, who fainted.
Ginny turned 50 in the episode, "Moe n' Joe", and her friends Carmela Soprano, Angie Bonpensiero, Gabriella Dante, Janice Soprano, and Rosalie Aprile attended a birthday celebration at her home. She discussed some difficulties with Allegra, who felt Ginny was not happy for her marriage. Gabriella pointed out that Allegra may just have been shocked to be less happy than she had expected to be as a newlywed.
Ginny was in court when Johnny admitted his involvement with the Mafia and received a 15-year sentence for racketeering. Ginny was forced to move when John arranged the sale of their home to Janice Soprano as part of an agreement with Tony to try to secure capital, for his family, following the asset seizures that came with his conviction.
Ginny visited her husband John in prison when he was diagnosed with cancer, and was at his side with their two daughters when he died. Tony mentioned, in passing (in the episode "Remember When") that Ginny had taken a job running an office, selling insurance.
Denise Borino, who portrayed Sacrimoni, received the part in a 2000 open casting call. She died of cancer on October 27, 2010.

Yaryna Kastropovic.
In 2007, in the episode "The Blue Comet," Yaryna and her father are murdered in a case of mistaken identity. Her father, who resembles Phil a lot, was mistaken for him and shot by an Italian hitman working on orders from Tony Soprano. Yaryna witnesses her father's death and she herself is shot multiple times. She falls down the stairs and lies motionless while the hitman stands above her body and shoots her in the head to make sure she is dead.
Meadow Soprano's one-time fiancé. The two met at Columbia University and began sharing an apartment together in her sophomore year (2002). Little is known of Finn's family life except that he is originally from Mission Viejo, California. Unlike Meadow, he is only part-Italian. Upon finishing college, Finn enrolled in dental school. For a brief period in the summer of 2004, Finn worked at a construction site run by the Aprile crew, a job Tony Soprano got for him. Finn struck up a friendship with the daughter of the site manager. One morning as he arrived very early to work, he saw Vito Spatafore fellating a security guard in a parked vehicle. Finn talked to Meadow about what he saw but she promised to keep his confidence. After Vito tried to intimidate Finn into attending a San Diego Padres and New York Yankees game with him, Finn panicked and decided to leave town before Vito came after him. Meadow was saddened and angered when Finn packed a suitcase without telling her or inviting her to accompany him and they argued. During the argument and when Meadow talked about a commitment, they decided to get engaged.
Meadow Soprano's friends and associates.
Finn DeTrolio.
In 2006, Finn returned from dental school to support Meadow while Tony was in a coma and, he admitted, to escape dental school, which he disliked. He had to face Vito again and Vito behaved in a predatory and flirtatious way towards him. Finn accompanied Meadow to Allegra Sacrimoni's wedding but seemed uncomfortable when the festivities prompted questions about their own wedding plans.
When Vito was spotted in a gay bar by two New York crew members making a collection, Meadow revealed Finn's secret to her mother and Rosalie Aprile. Then Carmela insisted Meadow tell her father. A visibly frightened Finn was brought to Satriale's to give his account of what he saw and his subsequent encounter with Vito to the senior members of the Soprano crime family. Finn's "testimony" proved highly significant in cementing the crew's belief that Vito was homosexual, since Finn was seen as a neutral party with no reason to lie.
Later, Meadow complained to Tony that she was having difficulties in her relationship with Finn. Finn attended a Sunday dinner shortly after this conversation. Meadow and Finn later broke up, as revealed in another Sunday dinner conversation, the implied reasons being that Finn was "abnormal".
Meadow Soprano's successful, star soccer coach and associate of Tony, Silvio, and Artie because of his involvement in coaching their children. Coach Hauser is a father himself with a daughter around Meadow's age and is married to a woman named Shelley. He was well liked by the fathers of kids in his team because of the success he brought them on the playing field. He tells Paulie that he has friends in law enforcement. He once had drinks with Tony, Silvio, and Artie at the Bada Bing club but refused Silvio's offer to go in the "VIP Room" with a stripper-prostitute. However once it was revealed Coach was leaving for another job at an exclusive academy for girls to head their team, the Soprano family began trying to intimidate him into staying. Paulie delivered a large screen television to his house and insisted he take it. Christopher returned his "missing" golden retriever - probably after taking it himself. He says that the "gifts" will not sway his decision because he has already decided to accept a coach position for the girls' team at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston. Meadow later revealed to her father that the coach had a sexual relationship with Ally Vandermeed, one of her peers who was a star soccer player on the team. Ally attempted suicide by cutting her wrists because of his trying to end the relationship by telling Ally he won't leave his wife for her. Tony, after an impassioned plea for temperance by Artie Bucco, decided against being a vigilante, and the coach ultimately was arrested by authorities for the statutory rape of Ally.
Meadow Soprano's roommate at Columbia University. Caitlin hailed from a small town in Oklahoma (she wears a Bartlesville High School sweatshirt). At first, she seemed to enjoy New York City and college life, at one time dancing in her underwear in front of Meadow after a night out drinking. However, she has manic-depressive disorder and frequently annoyed Meadow and the dormitory Resident Assistant and Meadow's boyfriend, Noah Tannenbaum, with her troubles. She went out with them for her birthday and had an anxiety attack after seeing a homeless woman with newspaper in her buttocks. When Meadow was away, she annoyed Noah while he was writing a term paper, causing him to get a bad grade and later, inspiring Noah to get his attorney father to file a restraining order against her. She practiced cutting and pulled out her own hair. At a fraternity party, she sees Jackie Aprile, Jr., who gives her ecstasy, which temporarily alleviates her depressive symptoms. Caitlin tells Jackie that she has a crush on him, then states to Meadow how handsome Jackie Jr. is and how lucky Meadow is to be dating him. Caitlin becomes aloof during the party, while high on ecstasy, and agrees to have sex offscreen with another frat boy at the party. Later she is shown comforting Meadow after her breakup with Jackie Jr., now appearing more emotionally stable.
Hunter is a good friend of Meadow Soprano. Her father is an advertising executive who Meadow thinks has a phony personality. She sang with Meadow in the school choir and the two hounded Chris to buy the speed to help them study. She had a crush on Brendan Filone shortly before his death and even wrote a poem for him. She attended the house party that was raided by the police at Livia Soprano's house after she had moved to Green Grove Retirement Community. Tony Soprano gives her the nickname "Janet Jackson" because of her wardrobe. Later she was accepted to Reed and visited Meadow just after she started there. Hunter drank with the soccer team around the time that their friend Ally Vandermeed tried to kill herself. In the final episode of the series, Carmela finds her talking to Meadow in her bedroom and casually mentions her expulsion from college. She has an aunt and uncle that are graduates of SUNY Purchase. Carmela is then quietly dismayed to learn that Hunter sorted her life out, went back to college at SUNY Purchase, and is now in medical school after graduating, which Carmela and Tony had hoped Meadow would enter.
Meadow Soprano's first boyfriend at Columbia; they met during a film course. Noah is from Los Angeles. His father, an entertainment attorney for various celebrities and Hollywood notables, is Jewish and his mother is African American. "Noah Tannenbaum" was originally going to be the stage name of Brooklyn-born singer Neil Diamond. Noah first appears visiting the Soprano home with Meadow to view a movie for a class project. Being a film buff, Noah thought he had common ground with Tony when he observed video equipment at the Soprano residence. He told Tony that, just like him, he is a big fan of Howard Hawks movies. Noticing that Noah was pursuing Meadow, Tony asked Noah a few questions about his ethnic background. Upon confirmation of Noah's African American heritage Tony attempted to intimidate Noah into staying away from Meadow, hurling racial slurs in the process. Following this heated discussion Noah leaves the house in a huff. The next time Meadow brought him to the house Noah would not get out of the car. Tony expressed his displeasure with Meadow for having any kind of relationship with him, starting a lengthy feud between Tony and Meadow which ultimately drove Noah and Meadow closer together. Later, after a visit from his father, Noah broke up with Meadow, saying she is "too negative" about things, though it was implied the real reason was pressure from his father due to Tony's criminal activities.

Her mother, following the news of Ally's sexual abuse is perscribed sedatives and Charmaine Bucco tells Artie that she has become "useless at home." Her parents are divorced and she is said to have tried committing suicide before. The relationship caused her to become anti-social and withdrawn from schoolwork and Meadow. Ally tried to kill herself by slicing her wrists displaying characteristics of having self harm disorder after the coach took another job elsewhere, but her friends found her and she survived. Meadow later had her over for a sleepover while she was recovering from the suicide attempt. Coach Hauser was arrested for the statutory rape of Ally. She sells cigarettes to Meadow and her friends on the soccer team.

Egon was the best friend of A.J. when they attended Verbum Dei School. Egon, like A.J., was also a troublemaker, having joined in with A.J. and several other children to trespass into the school's swimming pool when it was closed for the night and vandalize it by smashing trophy cases and throwing articles into the pool. Unlike A.J., Egon was not punished for the rampage as A.J. refused to rat out Egon and took the entire blame. Egon was also a poor student like A.J., and both boys were in danger of failing their geometry classes, a problem they sought to solve by breaking into the school after hours, this time to see an advance copy of the mid term exams and memorize the answers. Both are discovered by the headmaster of Verbum Dei when their superior test scores are reported as a suspicious improvement. While A.J. manages to evade the headmaster's intimidation, Egon breaks down in tears, revealing the cheating. Due to his prior disciplinary record, Anthony Junior is expelled from Verbum Dei.

Blanca has a 3-year-old son named Hector from a previous marriage and lives in an apartment building in South Passaic. She attended Christmas celebrations at the Soprano family home and met A.J.'s parents (Tony and Carmela Soprano), who were initially skeptical about the relationship for several reasons: she was not Italian, she was ten years A.J.'s senior, and she was a single mother, but they ultimately accepted it because she was Catholic like they were. Blanca lives in a neighborhood that had been disturbed by a youth gang, which A.J. steps up to deal with. He convinces the gang members to move on by bribing them with a bicycle. A.J. eventually proposes marriage to Blanca and she accepts, but later changes her mind and ends the relationship, sending A.J. into an emotional downward spiral that lasts for several episodes. Later while in therapy, A.J. is asked by his therapist if his feelings about Blanca parallel his feelings about a Somali boy who was beaten by classmates in front of him. A.J. initially objects vigorously to the analogy on account that "she's not black" but later reluctantly admits that she is "very tan". A.J. also deplores with compassion that Blanca's son barely talks because she cannot afford to send him to a better school. He contrasts that and other ills and inequalities in the world with the luxury in which his parents live.

Christopher Moltisanti's friends and associates.
J.T. Dolan.
J.T. dabbles in gambling and places horse bets with Christopher and finds a fondness for high-price poker games. J.T. borrows money from Christopher to play high-stakes poker and their friendship is effectively ended when he fails to pay it back on time. Little Paulie Germani and Chris beat J.T. up in his home and confiscate his BMW as a partial payment for his debts. Despite the beating, Chris later resumes their "friendship" when the debt has caused J.T. to relapse. As J.T. Dolan is enrolling in rehab again, Chris freezes the debt and assures J.T. that he will return to prosperous screenwriting. Later, as J.T was working as a full-time professor of a writer's class "The Writer's Block", Chris has J.T. forcibly abducted by "Murmur" and Benny Fazio and offers to clear the gambling debt if J.T. writes a screenplay for his feature movie project. J.T. agrees and writes the script for "Cleaver", a slasher horror film, from a story by Christopher, working on the film closely with Moltisanti and Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. who is its co-executive producer. However, when the film gets made in 2007, at its premiere, Christopher does not acknowledge Dolan's contributions to it when talking to the audience, leaving him embarrassed in front of his female companions. Also, the film's character, mob boss Sally Boy, upsets Tony Soprano for his apparent similarities to his person and Christopher attempts to do damage control when he orders J.T. (by hitting him over the head with his Humanitas prize) to tell Tony the character was his idea. J.T. does as instructed and spins a tale to Tony about plagiarizing the character from an old movie, but Tony remains unconvinced, particularly when he notices the cut on J.T.'s head.
When Christopher relapsed again in 2007, after his latest feud with Paulie Gualtieri and assumed ridicule and disrespect by the crime family, he attempted to find comfort by talking to J.T. one late night, as his current sponsor was out of town. J.T. was cold and unreceptive, angry at his unannounced intrusion and under pressure to finish a script deadline for a show. Heavily drunk, Christopher said that he had seen and done terrible things and started hinting his knowledge of mob crimes. J.T. angrily tried to get Christopher to stop talking about them, suggesting that he did not want to know. After J.T. exclaimed "Chris, you're in the Mafia!", Christopher walked away, then turned and shot him in the head, killing him instantly.

Salvatore complains that after listening to her answering machine he is always hearing a different man's voice, making him believe that Tina is cheating on him, which she does not answer. Tina's association with the family continued as a friend of Adriana La Cerva and she was expected to act as maid of honor in her planned wedding to Christopher Moltisanti. Tina upset Ade by constantly flirting with Chris and Ade retailiated by using her role as an FBI informant to reveal that Tina had been embezzling funds from the shopping service she works for. The consequences of this revelation are unknown, but we do see Ade's FBI handler writing down the information, and Tina subsequently vanishes from the show.
Liz is the mother of Adriana La Cerva. Liz was born Elizabeth Aprile and is a sister of the late Jackie Aprile, Sr. and Richie Aprile and sister-in-law to Rosalie Aprile (see family tree). Liz was never a big supporter of Adriana's relationship with Christopher Moltisanti and Ade often stayed with her following arguments or domestic violence. Following Adriana's disappearance in 2004, Liz was visited by the FBI who informed her that her daughter was believed to be dead and that they suspected Chris's involvement. When Carmela Soprano encountered her at the 2006 Feast of St. Elzear, Liz, having become convinced of her daughter's murder, was already showing evident signs of depression: she had stopped taking care of her appearance and later attempted suicide. Carmela visited her in the hospital, but Liz appeared to be unconscious at the time.
Amy was a woman engaged to Christopher Moltisanti's cousin Gregory Moltisanti from Essex County, New Jersey. Her father is a neurosurgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was pre-accepted into Yale University during her freshman year at high school. Amy says that she has also worked with Quentin Tarantino and says that they are "friends." She met with Christopher because of his interest in scriptwriting and the two had a brief affair while she is in New York filming a Janeane Garofalo and Sandra Bernhard lesbian spy movie. She was a Vice President of a movie development company and worked with real-life movie director Jon Favreau, with whom she also put Chris in touch. She is the official script writer for Favreau and once read a movie script submitted by Billy Bob Thornton to Favreau for her input which was rejected. Amy is helping Favreau do an autobiographical movie of mobster Joe Gallo. She ultimately turns down Christopher's script for a semi-autobiographical account of his life in organized crime.
Richie was an ex-boyfriend of Adriana La Cerva and her childhood neighbour in New Jersey. Richie was always a songwriter and musician but had changed his approach to life, giving up hard drugs and switching from glam metal to alternative rock, after an accident involving him receiving a near-fatal electric shock by a downed power line and receiving third-degree burns while high on heroin. When not writing or playing music he works at Kinko's. Richie changed the name and genre of his band, "Defiler", to an alternative rock band called "Visiting Day". His band members criticize Richie's songs for having no chorus in any of his songs and where the choruses are supposed to be, Richie just has another verse to the song. He had previously recorded music in Denmark. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings regularly. He does not like The Beatles. His 3-person band uses an array of instruments including a ukulele. Richie reconnected with Adriana when she began to pursue a career in the music industry and her new boyfriend Christopher Moltisanti bankrolled her efforts to produce a demo tape for Richie's band. Richie and the rest of the band had a hard time in the recording sessions and refused Christopher's offer of amphetamines to aid the process, unwilling to risk relapsing into his old habits. Chris eventually became so frustrated with Richie that he beats him with his own guitar. Ultimately, Chris decides to abandon the project, much to the chagrin of Adriana, who still believes they could make the big time. Richie and his band weren't mentioned again during the show's run.
He is a West African physician who specializes in neurology. Dr. Ba is responsible for checking Tony's neurological functions after Tony suffered a gunshot wound, inflicted in 2006 by his uncle Corrado Soprano.
Tony Soprano's neighbor and family physician. His main field is internal medicine. He referred Tony to Dr. Melfi, who is a personal friend whom he entertained at his home at a dinner party. He and his wife, Jeannie Cusamano, have a dog, Esterhaus. He once invited Tony to play golf with him and some friends but Tony was upset that they only seemed interested in his mafia stories. Tony exacted revenge on Bruce by asking him to hold onto a package filled with sand for him, for an unspecified length of time, without telling Bruce what was in it. Bruce and Jean were tempted to open the package but terrified to know what it held. Heroin or a gun were their guesses.
The doctor who treated Adriana and Tony Soprano after they were involved in the accident at Mount Mercy Hospital in Dover, New Jersey. Shortly after Tony was admitted, the doctor said that the tests indicated that Tony was ok to leave the hospital. When Tony asked if the doctor if he was sure he performed all the correct tests, the doctor became defensive, feeling Tony was implying the doctor was incompetent because he was black. He stated that he has a degree from Johns Hopkins University and that his grandmother (hinted at being Jane E. Mitchell, a nurse) was the first black woman licensed to practice medicine in Delaware. Later Tony Soprano and Tony Blundetto brought Christopher to see the doctor, in an attempt to convince Christopher that Adriana was not giving Tony fellatio in the car, therefore causing the accident. After Blundetto made a thinly veiled threat, the doctor confirms what the Tonys were trying to tell Christopher. He is impressed by Blundetto's medical knowledge thinking at first that he is a doctor. He affirms that the injuries Adriana had were consistent with her sitting upright during the time of the accident. Soprano then thanks the doctor and tries to give him money. The doctor refuses and leaves them in disgust.
The second psychotherapist of A.J., following Dr. Vogel. A.J. starts attending sessions with her after his discharge from the hospital's mental health ward. When A.J.'s parents get concerned about his wish to join the military, they go have a talk with Dr. Doherty, but Tony instead starts complaining and telling her about his own mother and upbringing. It could be said that Dr. Doherty is rather reminiscent of Dr. Melfi (except her blonde hair), down to her skirt and the crossed legs, as in, the same therapists for Tony and A.J. in a "like father like son" motif.
A player in the Soprano family's executive game - a high-stakes, all-night poker tournament and head of the Fried Medical Group with offices located throughout the tristate area. He is a doctor who specializes in treating erectile dysfunction, which is the source of much juvenile joking by the other card players. Dr. Fried was able to turn the tables when performing some out-of-hospital surgery on Furio Giunta after the attempted armed robbery at the Aprile social club. Furio, in agony, asks Tony "Who is this prick, is he a real doctor?" to which Dr. Fried replies, "Close - I'm a prick doctor, get it?!" In 2002 Dr. Fried acted as the initial property buyer in Tony's HUD scam - selling properties on to Maurice Tiffen at a profit. In 2004, Fried and numerous others were the victims of a large-scale car robbery at his daughter's wedding. He reached out to Tony about the theft. It turned out that Feech La Manna had organized the car theft scheme.
A general surgeon who is responsible for Junior's care when he has his colon cancer operation. Junior is in awe of the man but Tony is less impressed by his dismissive attitude and feels Junior is blinded by his physician's famous namesake. When Tony consults an oncologist to discuss Junior's post-operative care, a tumor panel is convened and Kennedy becomes reluctant to be involved in the case as his decision is questioned. Junior receives chemotherapy but Dr. Kennedy stops returning his and Tony's calls. Tony catches up with Dr. Kennedy on the golf course initially presenting him a club as a gift but it soon becomes clear he is there to intimidate the man. Shortly afterwards Dr. Kennedy visits Junior at his chemotherapy appointment and gives him his home phone number.
A counselor to whom Dr. Melfi refers Meadow. Kobler encourages Meadow to take a year off or participate in a college exchange program in Europe, much to her parents' dismay. She costs $200-a-session and says that it's Meadow's "right" to go to Europe and that she could pick up her education later. Through her academic connections Wendy says that if Meadow wants to stay in Europe that she could get her accepted into the University of Barcelona. Following the murder of Jackie Aprile Jr. she says that Meadow should consider going on Prozac to deal with the grief and sorrow of his death.
A Ukrainian-Russian Jewish therapist to whom Carmela Soprano is referred by Dr. Melfi after Carmela shows up, alone, to one of her and Tony's short lived couples sessions. He tells Carmela that he has been married for thirty-one years. Dr. Krakower bluntly tells Carmela she enables Tony's lifestyle and she will never overcome her guilt and shame about her life unless she cuts Tony out of it completely. He says that no matter if Carmela leaves or not before the end of their session he won't charge her for the visit. He advises Carmela to "take what is left of the children", divorce Tony, and accept no alimony or child support from him (as his is "blood money"), which probably also explains why Dr. Krawkower will not accept pay from Carmela. Carmela, unwilling to follow this advice, does not see Dr. Krakower again. He tells Carmela to have Tony read Fyodor Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment" if he goes to prison. Dr. Krakower's first name is never mentioned.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi's psychotherapist who also used to be her teacher. Elliot tries to convince her numerous times to refer Tony to another colleague. Elliot calls Dr. Melfi "Jen" in their sessions. Vin Makazian reveals to Tony when he is asked to put surveillance on her that she sees her own psychiatrist, Kupferberg, which surprises Tony.
Physicians.
Dr. Elliot Kupferberg.
Elliot has a daughter, Saskia, who is a lesbian and student at Columbia University, which Meadow attended.
In the episode "Employee of the Month," Elliot also counsels Melfi following her rape.
Elliot once unknowingly encountered Tony Soprano in the parking garage at Columbia University, while both were visiting their daughters. He followed Tony in his car in the hopes of taking Tony's parking space when he left but annoyed Tony by driving too closely, describing him later to Melfi in a therapy session as "this Bluto-type guy." He presented the encounter to Melfi as a way of saying that parking garages are not inherently dangerous places and that she should not blame herself for her rape. He thought that Tony may have been a maintenance man working in the building.
In 2007, following Tony's shooting by Junior and the rise of his media profile, Melfi accuses Elliot of directing their therapy towards discussing "Patient Soprano" because of his desire for gossip and continuous shows of interest. In the episode "The Second Coming," he tells Melfi of a study that concludes talk therapy enables sociopaths. In the episode "The Blue Comet," he further presses Melfi about Soprano at a dinner party, where he reveals to guests that Soprano is Melfi's patient, to her embarrassment, a serious breach of doctor-patient confidentiality, although he dismisses her protests casually, saying everyone at the table is a professional. Melfi is upset, but nevertheless later reads the study herself, which leads her to finally drop Tony Soprano as a patient at their next session.
Elliot seems to be interested in the Mafia on a personal level. In the episode "Stage 5", he can be seen watching the news when the Lupertazzi crime family is discussed, remarking: "This Santoro thing, I called it a year ago". He once tried to explain this interest to Melfi by saying that his father was a huge fan of "The Untouchables".
An Indian oncologist, with whom Tony arranges an appointment to discuss the best management of Junior's colon cancer. Mehta suggests they convene a tumor board meeting.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi.
Dr. Melfi is Tony Soprano's therapist.
Tony Soprano's attending physician, who treats Tony for his gutshot in 2006. He advises Tony that while he is healing from his gunshot wound that he might have erectile problems which eventually subside.
Junior Soprano's cardiologist, who allowed Junior to use his office to conduct meetings while under the pretense of coming in for medical appointments due to the physician-patient privilege clause that denies the FBI and authorities to listening in on their conversations, meeting with associates including Tony and Richie Aprile. After Corrado's fall in the shower and heart attack scare he tells Corrado the tremors were from the stress of the trial and the house arrest. Corrado refers to him in front of Tony and Richie Aprile as "the best goddamned heart doctor in the world." His father "Marty Schreck" was a wealthy bookmaker in New Jersey that Corrado used to do business with back in the 1950s. The FBI used this as an opportunity to gather information by inserting an agent, who posed as a nurse and talked to Junior. He perscribes Corrado a sleep breathing machine because he has forty arousals, meaning changes of sleep.
A psychotherapist whom A.J.'s pediatrician recommends to Carmela for therapy concerning A.J.'s depression. In the episode "The Second Coming," Dr. Vogel also enters A.J. into a mental hospital and arranges a group therapy session with him and his parents after A.J. tries to commit suicide.
Melfi eats dinner with Nils at Giuseppe's, where they bump into Tony Soprano accompanied by Silvio Dante and Paulie Gualtieri. Nils is astonished that she knows a Mafia figure and deduces that she must be treating him.
Jennifer Melfi and Richard LaPenna's son. He is not very close to Richard, and following his mother's rape grows even more distant from him. He attends prestigious Bard College in the Hudson Valley of New York. While dining with his mother at an upscale restaurant, Jason witnesses an incident wherein his mother gets into an argument with a stranger over smoking and is embarrassed when they are asked to leave because of her drunken behavior. After his mother's rape, Jason loses interest in his classes at Bard and vows revenge on Melfi's attacker and, in anger, asks the detective for five minutes alone with him.
Richard is the estranged husband of Jennifer Melfi and father of Jason LaPenna. When Dr. Melfi's family learn that she is treating a major mob figure, they urge her to end the association as it is unhealthy. Richard is a member of an organization that aims to combat the negative portrayal of Italian Americans as Mafia figures in the media. This Italian Anti-Defamation League is based on the real-life Italian-American Civil Rights League founded by Colombo crime family boss, Joe Colombo. Richard and Jennifer had reconciled in 2001 and he was living with her at the time of her rape. Richard was largely supportive and eager to seek justice for the rape. He originally thinks Jennifer's rapist is Puerto-Rican, but later finds out that he is partially Italian (Jesus Rossi) and is personally offended. He was very angry when mishandling of the chain of custody allowed the man to go free. However, Richard placed some of the blame for the rape on Jennifer, as she had parked in a poorly lit garage and left work late.
Friends, family and associates of Jennifer Melfi.
