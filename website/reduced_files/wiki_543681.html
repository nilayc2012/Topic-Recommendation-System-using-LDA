 <p>Nuremberg Diary (ISBN 0-306-80661-4) is Gustave Gilbert's account of and interviews he conducted during the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi leaders, including Hermann GÃ¶ring, involved in World War II and the Holocaust. Dr. Gilbert, a fluent German speaker, served as a prison psychologist in Nuremberg, where he had close contact with those on trial. The text is the verbatim notes Gilbert took immediately after having conversations with the prisoners, information backed up by essays he asked them to write about themselves. The diary was first published in 1947 and reissued in 1961, just before the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem.
