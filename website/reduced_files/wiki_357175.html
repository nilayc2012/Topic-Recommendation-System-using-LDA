 <p>The series was put on hold in 2003, as the magazine it was serialized in ceased its publication. It resumed serialization in November 2011 in Kadokawa's "Young Ace Magazine" under the new title, .
The four leading characters of Legal Drug appear in "CLAMP in Wonderland" 2, which is the first time Kakei and Saiga are seen animated; Kazahaya and Rikuo had been previously animated during a brief appearance in the "xxxHolic" anime, episode 6, and "xxxHolic Kei" episode 13.
Plot.
When Kazahaya Kudo collapsed in the snow one night and on the verge of death, he is rescued by a mysterious young man, Rikuo Himura, who takes him back to a pharmacy named the Green Drugstore.
Kazahaya, apparently running from his past, takes up work at the Green Drugstore alongside Rikuo. He comments that although Rikuo rescued him, he really feels indebted to the store's owner, Kakei, whom he thanks for his current accommodation and job. While their day job is quite simple, the boys are persuaded and, in some cases, practically forced by Kakei to take on strange extra jobs outside the store, which make use of their supernatural powers.
Crossover with other CLAMP works.
In the second volume of "Legal Drug", Kakei purchases clothes from "Piffle Princess" for Kazahaya to give to a girl from Ohto High in exchange for her uniform. In "Angelic Layer", this was a store selling "Angelic Layer" merchandise where people could practice fighting with their Angels. In "Suki", Piffle Princess appears as Caffe Piffle Princess, a café frequented by the main characters. Piffle Princess also appears in other CLAMP works, including "Chobits", "xxxHolic", "", "Kobato", and "Cardcaptor Sakura".
In the world in which "Legal Drug" occurs, Piffle Princess appears to be a popular clothing store. A dress from Piffle Princess is given to a student at also known as (the Japanese word for vomit (謳吐) is also spelled Ohto). Hinata Asahi from "Suki" — Hinata, her teacher Shiro Asou, and Ohto High all appear in "Suki" as well.
The Atashi character from "Chobits" appears, such as on a clock in the Green Drugstore.
Rikuo and Kazahaya have appeared in "xxxHolic"; Watanuki is sent out to purchase a hangover remedy and enters the drugstore where the two work. He sees ghostly images around them (Tsukiko and Kei) and observes that there is some strong bond between the two. Furthermore, the High Moon Urn Yūko Ichihara has obtained in volume 5 from the "anything store" is actually the same vase retrieved by Kazahaya and Rikuo in volume 2 of "Legal Drug". In volume 2, Kazahaya walks through the space between a telephone pole and a wall, as does Watanuki in "xxxHolic". Watanuki, after inheriting the shop from Yuko, appears as Kakei's customer in "Drug & Drop".
The Green Drugstore and its staff have made small appearances in "Kobato". The Green Drugstore, Kakei, Rikuo and Kazahaya are identifiable in the background of "Drop 5" and two characters who look like Rikuo and Kazahaya walk past Kobato in "Exam 9".
Kohaku from "Wish" has appeared recently in this series.
