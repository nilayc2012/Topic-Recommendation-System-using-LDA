 <p>The Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580 (1884), were the subject of an important United States Supreme Court decision. They were decided on December 8, 1884.
The case established the precedent that treaties, which are described in the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution as "the supreme law of the land," along with the Constitution itself as well as Federal legislation made pursuant to the Constitution, do not hold a privileged position above other acts of Congress, and other laws affecting "its enforcement, modification, or repeal" are legitimate.
