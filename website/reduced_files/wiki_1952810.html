 <p>Don't Eat the Neighbours (also known as "Big Teeth, Bad Breath") is a British/Canadian children's comedy series that originally aired in the United Kingdom and Canada in 2001-2002. It was filmed mainly with puppets, but occasionally used computer graphics. The series was focused on the characters Rabbit, Wolf, and their children. Music for the show was done by Jim Guttridge, with the theme done by Dan Gagnon, Sandy Nuttgens, and Michael Scott.
Only four episodes were released on VHS and DVD in the 2001 volume "A Rabbit for All Seasons".
Plot outline.

Although Wolf has a strong desire to eat Rabbit, his children develop close friendships with Lucy, rejecting traditional dietary preferences.
