 <p>Featured here is a chronological list of story arcs in the comic book series Ultimate Spider-Man, created by Brian Michael Bendis and Bill Jemas, and drawn by Mark Bagley until Stuart Immonen replaced him. "Ultimate Spider-Man" is a teenage drama, in background contrast to the adult Spider-Man in the Marvel continuity.
Note: Most of this arc was put into the Ultimate Spider-man game.
Note: The use of the character Tobey Maguire is a reference to his role as Peter Parker in the 2004 film Spider-Man 2.
The mini-series, "Ultimatum: Spider-Man Requiem" #1-2 written by Bendis and art by Bagley and Immonen, would explore the lives of supporting cast of the "Ultimate Spider-Man" after the crisis of "Ultimatum" as how are they are living their lives without the webslinger, such as J. Jonah Jameson's eulogy to the apparent fallen hero and Peter Parker's loved ones' grief over his disappearance. In Manhattan, the military and the surviving Ultimates searches for survivors of Magneto's attack, and Captain America finds the unconscious Peter Parker within the ruins of the city, revealed to be still alive. The story serves as a bridge between "Ultimate Spider-Man" and "Ultimate Spider-Man" vol. 2.
