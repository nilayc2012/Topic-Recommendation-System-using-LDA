 <p>The legal working age is the minimum age required by law for a person to work, in each country or jurisdiction.
Some types of labor are commonly prohibited even for those above the working age, if they have not reached yet the age of majority. Activities that are dangerous, harmful to the health or that may affect the morals of minors fall into this category.
