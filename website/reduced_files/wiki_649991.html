 <p>"Cease Fire" is the forty-first episode (production #215) of the television series "", the fifteenth of the second season.
Captain Archer negotiates a cease fire between the Andorians and the Vulcans.
Plot.
The Andorians and the Vulcans are locked in battle over a planet situated on the frontier between their two systems. The Andorians call it "Weytahn," and the Vulcans "Paan Mokar", and it is claimed by both sides. Andorian Commander Shran, however, has broken the treaty and reoccupied a settlement. With the Vulcans calling for a cease fire, Shran seeks Captain Archer's help with negotiations. Vulcan Ambassador Soval is reluctant to bring Archer in as mediator, but three Vulcans have been taken hostage, and Shran only trusts Archer (particularly since the events of "The Andorian Incident").
Archer and Sub-Commander T'Pol head down the planet for a meeting with Shran. His lieutenant, Tarah, is especially wary of T'Pol, but Archer manages to convince Shran to release one of the hostages as a sign of good faith. Soval then agrees to negotiations, but remains skeptical. Meanwhile, Shran has a tense moment with Tarah, who objects to his attempts to negotiate with the Vulcans. She would rather fight to reclaim the planet for the Andorians. As the shuttlepod nears the planet, it is fired on and forced to crash-land. Soval suggests the Andorians are trying to sabotage the peace talks, but Archer doesn't believe Shran would resort to such tactics. Shran is furious that Archer's shuttle was downed, but Tarah claims that it was the Vulcans trying to frame the Andorians.
Meanwhile, on "Enterprise", Commander Tucker must keep the Vulcan and Andorian vessels from firing on each another. To do so, he maneuvers between the two groups. Down on the surface, Archer, T'Pol, and Soval are attempting to make their way to Shran's location, when Soval is shot. Archer discovers that renegade Andorians are behind the attack, and captures Tarah. She initially denies involvement, but eventually confesses, and angrily informs Shran that there are others who feel the same way. With the situation under control, and with Archer's help, the two sides agree to a ceasefire and continued peace talks.
