 <p>Fictional history.
Originally from a , the normal variety of Horrors, called which are grotesque black-winged skeletal demons. An Inga Horror enters the human world by being attracted to the darkness inside human beings that its kind feed on, using an object as a portal to travel from the Demon World. Those items, called Inga Gates, are objects with large amount of darkness from either playing a role in some sort of naturally accumulated atrocity like mass murder or a traumatic experience left unresolved. There are also Inga Gates that are created by someone infusing the object with dark energies. Regardless, all Inga Gates are usually activated when person with inner darkness approaches them, with the emerging Horror turning that person or any other living thing nearby into a host body. From there, the Horror "evolves" into a unique form based on the Gate they emerged from with personal tastes and feeding habits. In some cases, instead of taking complete control, an Inga Horror can form a symbiosis with the host to act out the human's dark desires. Regardless, a human is dead the moment an Inga Horror possesses them and what remained of the host follows the Horror in death. Though rare, there are also some unusual Horrors that prefer to possess objects rather than living thing, not having a preference of prey as they consuming whoever comes into close contact one way or another instead. But the rarest Horrors are the ones that assume the form of large beasts without needing a host body, acting only on a primal and indiscriminate urge to feed. As revealed in "Guren no Tsuki", Horrors have influenced humanity's myths such as the people of Heian-kyo believing them to be Preta.
Three common things in Inga Horrors are the fact that they usually hunt at night, their blood can mark someone for death with Horrors having an increase desirability for the afflicted, and they speak in a language which can be understood by either someone learned in the Makai language or a potential host, usually adopting a human language upon possession. Though a Makai Knight can slay them on a regular basis, Horrors can never truly die so long as darkness exists in the hearts of men. Upon a physical death, the Horror's essence is sealed within a Makaiken until its essence is formed into a dagger that is entrusted to a Watchdog to be sent back to the Demon World. Though there is a one night relief in the that occurs once every 20 years to bar any passage of Horrors into the human world, a slain Inga Horror can still return later. Trace essences of slain Horrors latch onto a Makai Knight and accumulate, requiring him to undergo a ritualistic purification periodically. In the case of those who bear the title of Garo, the essence of Horrors that the Garo user slain eventually forms into a Zaji.
While stronger Horrors, especially those evolved to have unique forms and powers, tend to live and hunt alone when they make it into the human world, weaker ones, especially those with no desire to hunt on their own and are reliant on others to feed, tend to band together and form small community pockets, as revealed in "Garo: Makai Retsuden". Each of these communities have their own hideouts called "forts", despite having no fortifications of any kind. The forts have cages in which humans are kept as livestock to be consumed later. These Horrors are weak enough that a lone Makai Knight is more than enough to wipe a dozen or two of them out within minutes.
Despite their nature as enemies of humanity, some recurrent gaining notoriety as they are named and documented, Horrors are not always targeted for elimination. At times, they are re-purposed by Makai Priests to serve various functions, such as for sealing of other more powerful Horrors, experimentation, or those like Sedinbale sealed to provide their vast knowledge on various Makai-related matters. Even like Zaruba are created with Horrors that hold no enmity against humanity and have pledged their loyalty to the Makai order, the created items entrusted to certain Makai Knights of prestige.
In the events of "Yami o Terasu Mono" and "Zero: Black Blood", given humans as payment for their loyalty as familiars, the Inga Horrors are shown to be significantly weaker as they can be killed by Makai Knights at a quicker pace. These Inga Horrors lack unique Horror forms, mostly seen only in their human form even during battle while some can assume their true usual Horror form.
Messiah the Ultimate Horror.
 is the originator of all Horrors from the and has existed since the beginning of the conflict between Makai Knights and Horrors. Messiah is the most unusual Horror because she is the only Horror that appears almost perfectly human in form, resembling a giant white-skinned half-naked woman with long-clawed fingers and unique jewelry and tattoos around her head and shoulders. Her back contains a Taoist round disc. While the full range of her powers are never revealed, Messiah's abilities include magical shielding, animating her body tattoos into cannons, summoning Horrors by merely touching the ground she walks upon, and flight.
Messiah had long desired to enter the human realm but she could not cross through without a large source of energy. After sensing Barago's desperation for power, Messiah reveals herself in a Madō Book that contains forbidden techniques. Though only a shade of her true self, Messiah offers to give Barago the knowledge and power of the forbidden Makai methods in return to bring about the legendary Kiba. Barago wholeheartedly agrees to give up his soul for power and Messiah proceeds to start him on his path of destroying lives to set up the conditions to summon her in her full glory through Kaoru, who is a suitable vessel due to the conditions of her age and birth. But once he fulfills his part in her summoning by removing any trace of humanity in him, upon being awakened Messiah absorbs Barago using Kaoru's body as a medium to use his power to complete the process. Her plans to reach the human world are foiled by Kouga, who enters her realm and defeats her with spiritual help from Kaoru. She is ultimately defeated when, overconfident with her powers, she arrogantly fails to stop Kouga from running his sword into her head after he discards his armor. Shocked at how a normal human has defeated her, Messiah is forced back into her dormant state while releasing Kiba.
During the events of "Makai no Hana", it is revealed that Messiah can also be summoned to the human world through the blooming of the Demon Beast Eyrith. It becomes the goal of Kouga's son Raiga to prevent the return of one of his father's enemies by hunting down Eyrith with the help of Mayuri.
Messiah is portrayed by . In "Kiba Gaiden", she is voiced by in a flashback and while possessing her body.
"Garo".
These are the Horrors that appear during "Garo".
"Byakuya no Maju".
"" features new types of Horrors and dark forces.
Eruzu.
 is an arachnid Horror that possesses a young girl, using its host to target aggressive men. Its abilities, other than spider-related powers, include each surviving piece of its body being able to regenerate into a new Horror. This power means that Garo cannot simply cut it down and has to burn it, using his Blazing Armament technique.
Legules.
 is a Horror that has existed for over 1,000 years. The Makai community has no recorded history and his movements have no records. One thousand years ago during a solar eclipse, Legules successfully crossed through the barrier between worlds and revived his followers known as the Legules Family. Many Makai Knights and Makai Priests died that day in order to suppress the Horrors that Legules unleashed on humanity. To make sure that the catastrophe would never happen again, the Makai Priests created the Phosphorus Arrow to destroy the barrier and seal away Legules. One thousand years later, Legules manages to find another gateway to return to the human realm by assimilating a dead body to make it his own. Legules is not the usual variety of Horror, as he is seemingly demi-human and possessing elementals similar to Oni or Yokai.
He quickly begins building forces of his own by converting Horrors and a human into "his family". He then attacks Kantai during the night to find the Phosphorus Arrow so that he can complete his task of reviving his family. He tries to convert everyone, including the Madōgu of each Makai Knight, to join his forces. Tsubasa's Madōgu Goruba somehow gets possessed and Legules controls his bracelet body. When the night raid fails, he transfers himself into Goruba during the day and comes when people least suspect anything wrong. Legules takes the arrow and Rin Yamagatana with him, as he needs her blood to activate the arrow.
Legules's capabilities include, and are not limited to, bodily assimilation, dark magic, immunity to regular physical attacks, human energy absorption, body transference, martial arts, ultra human strength, ultra healing, body parts that can move without attachment, and biological transfiguration. Once the eclipse begins, Legules transformed himself into his true form, a giant metallic skeleton-like Horror. In this form, he is able to transform into a bladed metal wasp. Legules is defeated when Garo throws the Phosphorus Arrow into him and destroys the barrier at the same time. With Legules destroyed, the demon family vanishes.

Aomushi.
 is a murderer who is trying to dispose of a body that Legules takes over. Aomushi is given the chance to live by becoming a servant to him. Legules fires demonic energies from his eyes to the man's eyes, transforming Aomushi into a member of the Legules Family. Though not possessed, Aomushi counts as a Horror because he serves as an extension of Legules like those he converts. His capabilities are cloaking and being acrobatic. He eventually suffers a severe injury in combat from Tsubasa and Legules finishes him off as he has no use for him, reverting Aomushi to his original form.
Aomushi is portrayed by and is voiced by .
Karakuri.
 are Horrors that are changed by Legules. Legules carries with him demonic masks and transforms live Horrors into his Legules family foot soldiers. Just like regular Horrors, they are able to enter humans and take control of them. However, they seem to be unable to blend in naturally as the regular Horrors can behave like a normal person. Their movements are very mechanical and move almost like karakuri puppets. They have high regenerative capabilities, bladed weapons as arms, and seem to have a ninja-like combat method. Their combat potential and strength is not above a regular Horror, but Horrors act independently as these Horrors serve a master. They do not speak, but merely make sounds and shift their eye sockets up and down as they react to their environment. Their body parts are known to function on their own even though if dismembered. They are all destroyed as the result of Legules's death.
"Red Requiem".
"" features two of , the generic name for seven powerful Horrors who are near equal to Messiah, and their followers.
Karma.
 is a and one of the Apostle Horrors who lives in a mirror rather than human hosts, though she can turn a human into a Horror familiar if their darkness is great enough. She consumes human souls by showing illusions of their greatest desires, drawing them into her mirror realm and turning their bodies into piles of broken mirror shards to ingest with their souls trapped in the mirror world. Among her victims are untold numbers of Makai Knights who came to slain her, only to be defeated and devoured. Karma is able to jump from mirror to mirror if the one she is currently housed in is destroyed. The sorrows and hatreds of people consumed by her are used for her as childlike and the shadowy . Eventually, forced to fight Garo, Karma assumes a giant mirror-shard themed harpy form while trying to convince Garo to swear loyalty to her in return for immortality. However, empowered by the fallen Makai Knights' souls within the realm, Garo destroys Karma.

Babel.
 is a and one of the Apostle Horrors, a gigantic bull-like beast with a large headpiece resembling a guillotine with a blindfolded, naked human female form mounted on its front. The blade of the headpiece, tethered by the chains running through the Horror's body, can be launched. Unlike other Horrors, Babel is a cannibal and feeds on its own kind, posing as an infant in a carriage before being found out and destroyed by Garo.
Kurusu.
 is a Horror under Karma. Originally an elderly painter named , Kurusu was driven mad by the death of his lover, Shion. He eventually snaps and kills a girl he was using as a model for a painting, trying to emulate Shion onto her. Karma, hearing his anguish, transforms him into a Horror, restoring his youth, and revives the said girl's corpse in Shion's image. In his human form, Kurusu fights with a large sword, holding it in a reverse grip. His Horror form is a large, skeletal creature composed half of bone and half of a fleshy substance. Finding Shion dead, Kurusu goes after the Kouga and Rekka while refusing to accept his love for the girl is a lie before being destroyed by Garo.

Shion.
 is a Horror under Karma. In reality, she is a Horror created from the corpse of a girl Kurusu murdered prior to his transformation and altered to resemble the real Shion who died long ago. Her Horror form is not monstrous like most, only possessing a single white wing and an angelic outfit. She is killed by Rekka, her body lasting long enough for Kurusu to find before it dissolves into feathers.

"Kiba".
These are the Horrors that appeared in "Kiba Gaiden".
Garius and Blade.
 and are two Horrors that were among the many that were absorbed by Kiba. While Garius is a serpentine flyer, Blade is a giant mantis-like monster.
Kokuryū.
 is a dragon-like Horror that exists within the mind of Barago in "Kiba Gaiden" and exists in a space produced by Sigma Fudō in "Makai Senki".
Gyanon.
 is one of strongest Horrors in existence, labeled as and the . Having seemingly died, the Makai Senate sent a group of three Makai Knights and one Makai Guide to retrieve the monster's corpse from Amber Rock Valley. However, Barago also sought the Horror and Gyanon was nowhere to be found by either party. It is revealed in "Makai Senki", that Sigma Fudō had stolen Gyanon as he intends to utilize the Horror in powering up his Magōryū Idea while reviving the fiend with large numbers of human sacrifices. To achieve this goal, Sigma obtains the pelt of a Spirit Beast to ensure the revived Gyanon is under his complete control while infusing Kouga's body and soul into the Horror to complete his resurrection. Though Kouga is freed, Gyanon awakens after Idea's creation in response to Sigma's darkness, devouring him and assimilating the ultimate Gōryū while assuming his androgynous human-like form. While telling Garo that his resurrection was unplanned, Gyanon intends to take advantage to bring all Horrors into the human world. However, Idea is destroyed with the Makai Knights and Madou Priests joining forces with Gyanon reduced to a head as Garo destroys the bodiless Horror.

These are the Horrors that appear in "".
"Yami o Terasu Mono".
Madō Horrors.
 are a unique form of Horror first created by Zedom by infusing human bodies with Horror Seeds, which germinate into Madō Horror Plants that spread across the body. As a result, unlike regular Horrors, Madō Horrors are born directly within the bodies of humans regardless if they have an innate darkness or not, willing or otherwise. Though bound ultimately to serve Zedom, Madō Horrors also answer to anyone who sires them as loyal servants in Zedom's absence. The personality of the sired human is retained to an extent, but warped in a way to suit to its master's needs, allowing Madō Horrors to adapt more easily than Inga Horrors with the need to feed a secondary priority. The need varies from one person to another, some might feed constantly while others only do so when they need to fight better or heal damage. This also enables them to hide from the usual means of Horror detection, with Makai Knights and Makai Priests forced to use investigative deduction to hunt Madō Horrors before developing a specific device that exposes a Madō Horror's red eyes and lined face markings to confirm their identity. Unlike most Inga Horrors that devour human bodies, Madō Horrors rip the soul off a human and devour it with the body turning to dust. In a fight, Madō Horrors can create weapons from parts of their bodies and are stronger than Inga Horrors. The process of Madō Horrors being sired varies on their inner strength, which can be quicken to a certain extent with Zedom's Requiem. Due to the possibility of being sired without consciously knowing it, the turned humans can be blissfully unaware of the transformation until their powers and nature awaken by their first feeding. Ultimately, because of their origins as innocents, a Madō Horror is as much a victims as those they consume.
During the events of "Yami o Terasu Mono", Tousei creates his Madō Horror minions, using them to create a shadow empire within Vol City, from the Madō Horror Plants resulting from forcing Hakana to germinate Madō Horror Plants from the Zedom Seeds, seeded within her by accident from Zedom's Arm. However, Hakana altered the batch of Madō Horror Plants inside her for the purpose of restoring the Garo armor. As a result of singing enhancing them and the armor's restoration, these stronger Madō Horrors can only be slain by one bearing the title of Garo. However, other than Ryuga seeing Hakana's memories, there is adverse effect from killing these Madō Horrors one by one as the armor temporary regains its glow while rendering it unwearable for the moment. It was once all Madō Horrors in the city are slain that the Garo armor is restored to its original state.
Zedom.
 is an Ancient Horror, labeled as the , whose body is composed of various blocks and alter themselves into weapons. Zedom created the first Madō Horrors in order to create the most powerful Horror army to conquer the world. However, Zedom is defeated by the Makai Priests of old with his body broken into pieces and each part sealed at various locations, with his head buried under the site of Vol City with the Goddess Statue erected, through the sacrifice of large numbers of Makai Priests, to keep the Horror imprisoned. The seeds from his body parts that were used to create Madō Horrors were entrusted to the Makai Priests who sealed the Horror, with two Makai Priestesses enacting a ritual where they open the Hill of Zedom's Arm's seals long enough to painfully absorb a Zedom seed, and grow a Madō Horror Plant from which Soul Metal is developed from. Though sealed, Zedom retained consciousness and witnessed the Makai Knights' birth, resulted in his resentment of the Makai Order for using his body parts to develop weapons used against his kind.
Due to Tousei's actions fifteen years prior, Zedom's arm briefly emerged from the corrupted seal it was trapped in, infusing Hakana with more seeds than initially intended and knocked her out. When he attempts to harvest a new supply of seeds from the Horror's head for Rian to absorb, Tousei ends up awakening Zedom when one of the seeds accidentally falls back into the seal. As a result, Zedom begins to destroy the Goddess Statue in order to break free from his prison while having Sonshi acquire a Makai Knight to serve as his new body. Taking the lifeless Sonshi after he was killed as a vessel and altering it into a militant dressed form, Zedom attempts to recruit the Makai Knights in serving him before resolving to remake the world in his image. Although he is incredibly powerful, Zedom inadvertently created a weak spot within himself when he destroyed Burai, who offered to serve as a host to stop the Horror. Further weakened by a special arrow fired by Aguri into the said spot, Zedom is slain by the combined effort of the Makai Knights under the Garo armor's influence.

"Zero: Black Blood".
Ring.
 is a powerful skeletal and anthropomorphic bird-like Horror who is the main antagonist of "", appearing in the form of a handsome European gentleman dressed immaculately and predominantly in a white suit. Unlike most of his kind, though he considers humanity very selfish, Ring actually plans to have co-existence between his kind with humans as an improvement to how his kind normally feed, believing that doing so will bring lasting peace to both humans and Horrors. Ring begins this agenda by establishing a community where he offers sanctuary to humans escaping from reality. His only condition for someone to be accepted into the community is to undergo a monthly lottery, where there is a 2% chance that one of them would ingest a pill containing crystallized Horror blood to become a Blood Dolce for his fellow Horrors to feed on. Ring's plan also relied on Iyu's calming singing ability, having also fell in love with her to the point of obsession as it allowed him to maintain his sense of self, and keeping the humans serene and indifferent to the arrangement. Though Ring usually opts to settle things peacefully instead of resorting to violence, he is a powerful Horror who can transform his feathers into various weapons. In a state of rage however, Ring reverts to his colossal true form where he loses control over his Horror instincts unless Iyu sings to him. After devouring Iyu when she refuses to sing for him any longer, Ring is eventually slain by Zero with help from Yuna.

"Makai no Hana".
Ady Slate Horrors.
In "", besides the run of the mill Inga Horrors, there are nine special Horrors used by Makai Priests in the foundation of Eyrith's sealing. Unlike common Horrors, having been exposed to Eyrith's power, their personalities are dominant over their human hosts to the point where they won't recognize people the humans had known. They cannot be sealed within Makai Blades when vanquished and their essence congeals into stones. Mayuri is sent by the Senate to seal these stones due her power to seal Horrors within her body, using them to reform the Ady Slate after Eyrith is defeated.
Eyrith.
 is an ancient plant-like Horror labeled as , and the originator of the Makai Trees. Eyrith is also tied to a legend that her flower, the , has the power to resurrect the dead. Ages ago, Eyrith was sealed in the by Makai Priests using nine other Horrors as foundation stones. Having left the slate where it was after the sealing is completed rather than secure it, the slate was forgotten throughout the ages even by the Makai Order until it was eventually dug up in present-day by archaeologists. The slate ended up in a museum as an archaeological relic until a mysterious person, who is later revealed to be Eiji Busujima, unraveled the seal after opening hours.
Despite the slate's unsealing, Eyrith remains as a seed and is hidden within Idora, one of the Ady Slate Horrors who were also freed and each possessing the first human with inner darkness they come across. However, as Mayuri explained in the worst-case scenario, Eyrith would bloom within 100 days and enable Messiah's return by removing the boundaries that separate the human world from the Demon World. Though Raiga nearly succeeds in capturing it by slaying Idora once he finds her, Eyrith escapes by transferring its essence into the Ady Slate Horror Gogeet. As such, it is deemed impossible to capture and seal Eyrith until the remaining Ady Slate Horrors have been slain and sealed first. Despite Raiga finding and slaying Gogeet, Eyrith transfers into the last Ady Slate Horror left, Jienda, which is soon captured and Eyrith's seed is extracted by Eiji Busujima.
Accepting Busujima's wish to bring back his lover, Eyrith produces a cloned body of Akari that will come to life the moment Horror is fully grown and blooms. When the time of her blooming draws near, Eyrith intends to turn Mayuri into her host to reach the place where she can bloom. However, Crow offers himself to her in order to spare Mayuri. Seeing that the now-repentant Busijima no longer has his original wish, Eyrith cancels her pact with him and brutally beats him up when he tries to stop her. Once reaching her destination, Eyrith leaves Crow's body and assumes her true human-like form before proceeding to grow into a giant tree. From there, recruiting Zaji to wipe out the line of Garo by targeting Rekka and Rian, Eyrith proceeds to spirit numerous Horrors from across time and space so that the bulb on top of her body can bloom and she can unleash a Horror army on the world. When Raiga attempts to destroy the bulb, Eyrith manifests a nude demonic version of her human form to fight him. Ultimately, the fight ends with Eyrith revealed to be the one who took Raiga's parents from him before she uses her temporal powers to suck out the Makai Knight's remaining time in the Garo armor so he can drive off his friends in his Lost Soul Beast form while she can bloom without interference. However, Raiga is later awakened as the Light Awakening Beast Garo and promptly resume to foil her plans. In a desperate bid to further demoralize Raiga, she tells him that all she has summoned are Horrors in both the past and the future and how his attempts have ended in vain, to which Raiga asserts that they will be taken care of by the Makai Knights of the past and future, as he proceeds to destroy the rest of her tree body. Left defenseless, Mayuri releases all nine stones at once and seals what remains of Eyrith in the Ady Slate once more.

"Gold Storm Sho".
These are the Horrors that appear in the film and television series "". The majority of Horrors in the television series are recruited servants of Zinga.
Degol.
, known as the mad Horror, is an ancient red-skinned Horror that rampaged the area Line City was built on ages ago. Degol killed the Makai Priest Sōtatsu before being slain by a previous Garo, with only his arm remaining as it was eventually sealed in a small shrine located in Line City since it could not be destroyed. However, unaware that a fragment of Degol was in his body, Agō obtained the horror's hand in an attempt to use Ryume to transmit the Horror's energy across Line City to kill everyone. But Degol eventually awakens and consumes Agō, creating a new centaur-like body before being slain for good by Ryuga with help from Agō.

Zinga.
, is the main antagonist of the television series "Garo: Gold Storm Sho", a cynical and arrogant manipulator who was once a Makai Knight. As revealed in "", well-known among the Makai Order with a nickname derived from his title, Zinga first met Amily during a mission to retrieve a Spirit Beast pelt delivered by her group of Makai Priestesses. Despite initial first impressions, Zinga fell in love with Amily and eventually married her. Zinga continued to travel the county with Amily by his side, hunting Horrors while training their son Yuuto to succeed him. When they arrived at a village that was offering sacrifices to quell the rage of a Horror that was believed to be a rural demon, Zinga and Amily offered to slay it and left Yuuto at the village. After a long battle, Zinga and Amily defeated the Horror but when they returned to the village, they found that the villagers were skeptical of their return and had used Yuuto as a sacrifice. This led Zinga to lose his mind as he and Amily proceeded to go on a killing spree in their utter rage. Zinga and Amily were stopped by a Makai Priest Moyuru who sacrificed himself to allow Gald and Haruna, survivors of the slaughtered village, to escape to his home village Homura. Though they wanted to die for their actions, Zinga and Amily survived Moyuru's suicidal attack. The two later happened to wonder into an Inga Gate in the form of a gravestone ring in the forest at night, and the Inga within them transformed them into their current Horror incarnations. Zinga saw his transition into a Horror as form of freedom as he freely admitted to have once been like Ryuga as a human, referring to his newfound nature as an aphrodisiac. Years later, though he admits that he once considered revenge as a motive, Zinga decides to release Radan and become its king to rule the world.
Zinga begins his schemes of freeing Radan by tricking a Makai Priest into breaking the seal on the Horror Radan for his own agenda. He manages to gain one of the twin daggers that form the Hōken and seeks the other while waiting for Radan to reawaken. He also employs Horrors by creating Inga Gates and offering the emerging Horrors human hosts. When the daggers resonate with each other, he and Amily casually go to meet Raiga and Rian and promptly reveal themselves to be Horrors, seeing that the time is right to take the other dagger. He and Raiga fight each other and gains the upper hand, but when they use the sealing daggers to continue fighting, the blades transform into longswords upon contact. The fight ends in a standstill as Gald grabs both swords and merges them back into a single Hōken. Regardless, Zinga later abducts Gald in an attempt to find where he has hidden the Hōken, but he still has a fixation on Ryuga and orchestrates a side scheme to have the young Makai Knight give in to his darkness. After transferring his spiritual essence into Rian when his physical form is destroyed by Ryuga, Zinga attempts to consume her being to create a new body for himself while taunting Ryuga with Rian's memories. But Rian manages to make Zinga prisoner in her own mind while the others attempt to purge him from her with the waters of a holy spring. Amily stops the summoning ritual and kisses Rian to absorb Zinga's spiritual essence, allowing him to completely consume her to restore his physical form. Zinga later reconstitutes Amily's body and the two enter Radan before assuming his place as its king, while directing the giant to make its way to the city to take everyone's life energy. The plan fails and Zinga is slain by Ryuga.
Being a former Makai Knight, Zinga uses a tainted Makaiken as his weapon. Since his transition into a Horror, noted by his platinum blond hair, Zinga's Horror form is a grotesque version of his Makai Knight armor, predominantly in crimson and black, which he summons forth by swiping his left fist sideways. In his Horror state, Zinga can sprout webbed wings for flight and has a tail with a sharp spine on the end to grab others. As taking Radan's throne requires the consumption of Horrors, he and Amily become cannibals and occasionally devour transformed Horrors.
Zinga is portrayed by .
Amily.
 is Zinga's assistant, a cannibal Horror who was originally a Makai Priestess and Zinga's wife. As revealed in "", being timid and inexperienced, Amily was from the Seiran Valley where many Makai tools are developed. She met Zinga while delivering a Spirit Pelt pelt alongside her fellow Makai Priestesses, having a bad first impression of before getting to know him better and developed feelings for him. Amily later married Zinga after completing her training and traveled with him alongside their son. But when their son was sacrificed by villagers who were terrorized by a Horror that she and Zinga killed for their sake, a grieving Amily aided her husband in slaughtering the villagers. The two were stopped by the Makai Priest Moyuru who sacrificed himself to save Gald and Haruna, some of the few survivors. After surviving Moyuru's suicidal attempt to kill her and Zinga, the two later happened to wonder into an Inga Gate in the form of a gravestone ring in the forest at night, and the Inga within them transformed them into their current Horror incarnations.
Being a former Makai Priestess and armed with a Madō brush, arrogant and seductive in her current state, Amily has extensive knowledge of magical spells and uses blue butterfly constructs as her spies, eating them to acquire their knowledge, while also recruiting Horrors to serve Zinga's purposes. Amily also possesses the Demon Mirror, a relic that allows its user to increase another's power. Amily helps Zinga in his plan to revive Radan, even revealing to Ryuga and Rian that she and her husband are Horrors when the pair are sent to reseal Radan. While captured by Ryuga's group, Amily feigns regaining her remorseful humanity to trick Ryuga into entering the Demon Mirror and then escaping Gald and Daigo's custody to meet back up with Zinga.
When Zinga transfers his spiritual essence into Rian, Amily sends her blue butterfly constructs to find him. She eventually discovers his location and Amily interferes in Ryuga, Daigo, and Ryume's ceremony of banishing Zinga from Rian's body. Amily takes Rian and kisses her, absorbing Zinga's spiritual essence into her own body so he can restore himself before reconstituting her body later. Once Radan is activated, Amily, in a blue dress composed of her butterfly familiars, offers herself to become the castle's moon-like power source. But after Rian mortally wounds her, Amily ends up being killed by Zinga who has turned Rian into the new power source.

Radan.
 is an ancient Horror, labeled as the , and is said to be a fortress too powerful to be destroyed. Once fully activated by two Horrors, with one becoming its ruler while the other becoming a moon that serves as its power source, Radan can absorb the life from the surrounding environment with its staff, open portals to the Makai, fire an unlimited supply of projectiles, and command Horrors to form a scythe-like blade on its staff. The interior of Radan also serves as a defense system. Upon the death of Radan's previous king, two Makai Priests from Homura Village used the elements of Yin and Yang to create two daggers that form the Hōken blade that they used to seal Radan in the space between the human world and the Demon World.
In modern times, Zinga and Amily trick the Makai Priest Gen into helping them break the seal on Radan, with Zinga obtaining one of the Hōken's dagger components, while the other is retrieved by Ryuga and Rian. Zinga releases Radan with the intent to sit at its throne, going so far as to becoming cannibal to fulfill its requirement of needing its king to have consumed Horrors. Despite attempts by Ryuga and his allies to seal Radan while they still can, it is awakened during the next full moon after its release and it flies off to await its chosen denizen.
