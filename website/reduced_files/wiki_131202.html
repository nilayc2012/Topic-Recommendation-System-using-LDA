 <p>Mystery Island is a live-action sci-fi adventure serial produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that originally aired as a segment on "The Skatebirds" from September 10, 1977 to January 21, 1978 on CBS.
In the fall of 1979, "Mystery Island" continued to air on "The Skatebirds" when the show returned to CBS in a shortened half-hour version on Sunday mornings until January 25, 1981. In September 2005, episodes resurfaced on Boomerang and were rebroadcast as part of "Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels".
Summary.
The series follows the adventures of three young people: Chuck Kelly (Stephen Parr, born August 24, 1947 in Brooklyn, NY), a pilot; Sue Corwin (Lynn Marie Johnston, born February 25, 1953), a computer expert; her younger brother Sandy (Larry Volk, born July 15, 1951 in Bismarc, ND and died July 20, 2010) and their computer robot called P.O.P.S. (voiced by Frank Welker). The trio become stranded on a remote island after the evil mad scientist Dr. Strange (Michael Kermoyan, born November 29, 1921 in Fresno, CA and died September 21, 1994 in New York, NY) uses his projector beam ray to crash their plane. Dr. Strange hopes to capture P.O.P.S. and use it in his quest for world domination.
"Mystery Island" was very similar in scope to Sid and Marty Krofft's 1976 live-action series "Dr. Shrinker" (from "The Krofft Supershow") which also saw a trio of humans on a plane brought down to the island of a different mad scientist. A total of sixteen episodes of "Mystery Island" were produced, each running ten minutes and included a cliffhanger that was resolved in the next installment.
About P.O.P.S..
The P.O.P.S. prop costume was a re-use of the original Robot B-9 from the 1960s television series "Lost in Space", modified with a bubble on its shoulders, a cylindrical (rather than bubble) head, a blue-and-white paint job, and other minor changes (P.O.P.S. image.). It has since been restored to its original Robot B-9 appearance.
(It should be noted that there are at least two other henchmen, but they are never named and never speak, and are played by two sets of actors who switch from episode to episode.)
