 <p>The Undead is a 1957 horror film directed by Roger Corman starring Pamela Duncan, Allison Hayes, Richard Garland and Val Dufour. It follows the story of a prostitute, Diana Love (Duncan), who is put into a hypnotic trance by psychic Quintis (Dufour), thus causing her to regress back to a previous life. Hayes later starred in "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" (1958). The film was released by American International Pictures as a double feature with "Voodoo Woman".
Plot.
The psychic sends the prostitute back in time to find out about her past-life experiences. She goes back as Helene, a woman from the Middle Ages who is to die at dawn under suspicion of being a witch. In an attempt to save Diana (the prostitute) and keep all of time from being distorted, Quintis (the psychic) goes back in time to convince Helene to let herself be killed. If she avoids her death, it will change history.
Production.
"The Undead" was inspired by an interest in reincarnation during the 1950s (as was the film "The She-Creature"). Notably the book "The Search for Bridey Murphy" by Morey Bernstein was made into a film in 1956. Charles Griffith recalls:
It was originally called “The Trance of Diana Love”. Roger said to me, “Do me a Bridey Murphy picture.” And I told him that by the time Paramount finishes theirs, ours will fail. At the time, everybody was saying that they were making a bad picture. He just said that we’d get ours ahead of theirs and clean up. So I did “Trance of Diana Love” and it got shot funny, especially at the end, where you see the empty clothes before the revelation. It was in iambic pentameter and I had to rewrite it after it was ready to shoot because somebody told Roger that they didn’t understand it. Roger would give it to anybody to read or anybody out on the street. He’d send girls out with scripts.
Griffth later elaborated:
I separated all the different things with sequences with the devil, which were really elaborate, and the dialogue in the past was all in iambic pentameter. Roger got very excited by that. He handed the script around for everybody to read, but nobody understood the dialogue, so he told me to translate it into English. The script was ruined, but "The Undead" [the final title] was a fun picture to shoot, because it was done in ten days at the Sunset Stage, which was a supermarket on Sunset Boulevard. We filled it with palm trees and fog, and it was the first time Roger had used any of that stuff. He didn't like to rent anything. You could see the zipper on the witch's dress and all the gimmicks were very obvious and phony—Roger deliberately played to skid row, a degenerate audience.
By the time "The Undead" was being made, the popularity of reincarnation was starting to dwindle. Therefore, Corman decided that they needed to change it up a little and added the time travel elements of Quintis, and a title change.
The movie was made for Walter Mirisch at Allied Artists.
The movie was filmed in a converted supermarket, and was completed in only six days. The bats that the imp and witch continually change into were left over from another Corman movie, "It Conquered the World".
Gri
Reception.
The "Los Angeles Times" called it "a rather imaginative yarn... for this type picture the acting is quite good... Corman has turned out a good product."
Legacy.
"The Undead" was later featured on "Mystery Science Theater 3000" during its eighth season where they comment on everything from small sets, tossing cats, bad dialog, and the horrors of having seen other Corman movies.
