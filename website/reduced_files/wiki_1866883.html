 <p>"Casualty" is a British medical drama television series that premiered on 6 September 1986 on BBC One. The series was created by Jeremy Brock and Paul Unwin. It is set in the fictional Holby City Hospital, in the equally fictitious city of Holby, and features occasional crossovers of characters and plots with spin-off show "Holby City". "Casualty" follows the professional and personal lives of the doctors, nurses, paramedics, hospital management and patients at Holby General. It features an ensemble cast of regular characters, and began with 10 main characters in its first series, all but two – Charlie Fairhead (played by Derek Thompson) and Lisa "Duffy" Duffin (played by Cathy Shipton) – have since left the show. Many main characters have been written in and out of the series since. In addition, "Casualty" features guest stars each week, as well as recurring guests that take part in story arcs that span a portion of a series or multiple series'.
Main characters.
A.
Jez Andrews.
Jeremy "Jez" Andrews, played by Lloyd Everitt, made his first screen appearance on 12 March 2016. The character and Everitt's casting was announced on 29 January 2016, whilst further details announced on 24 February 2016 with the casting of David Hide (Jason Durr) and Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths). Executive producer Oliver Kent described the three castings as "wonderful" and said their storylines would be "brilliantly vibrant, bold and gripping". Jez is characterised as a "young, ludicrously handsome and very openly bisexual" paramedic. 
Kent teased the dynamic between Jez and his paramedic colleague, Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson), calling it "fun" and "unlike anything we’ve seen before". Tasha Hegarty of "Digital Spy" described Jez as "Iain's new partner in crime". It was announced that Jez would "fail to impress" Iain with his "cheeky banter and lax attitude" upon his arrival, and would struggle to replace Iain's former colleague, Dixie Dixon (Jane Hazlegrove). Kent also revealed that a "big" friendship would be established between Jez and Max Walker (Jamie Davis). Everitt had already filmed his first scenes when his casting was announced and revealed that his favourite thing to film had been a scene where he rescued a girl from falling from a cliff, "I actually felt it was a real life situation and that excited me." Of his casting, Everitt said, "I feel honoured to be joining such a successful show and look forward to bringing a different essence to a programme that's synonymous with British culture and television. It's actually the first programme I remember watching when I was a child at my Nan's house - there's a great beauty to that."
Jez arrived and tried flirting with Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) until his colleague, Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson), revealed she was the department's clinical lead. Jez and Iain escorted Emilie Groome (Carol Royle) to a hospice, where she would spend her final days. They stop the ambulance during the journey whilst her sons and doctors, Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford) and Caleb Knight (Richard Winsor), treat her. Jez allows Cal to steal the ambulance so he can take Emilie to the seaside. Jez then spends the rest of the day trying to impress Iain with his banter whilst they search for a lift back to the hospital. Jez finally wins Iain over and they receive a lift back to the hospital. Jez installs a basketball hoop in the ambulance bay and befriends Max Walker (Jamie Davis), who often spends time playing basketball with Jez. Max and Robyn Miller (Amanda Henderson) then begin renting a room to Jez.
Martin Ashford.
Martin "Ash" Ashford, played by Patrick Robinson, is introduced in the first episode of series 5, first broadcast on 7 September 1990. Ash left on 24 February 1996, but returned on 21 February 1998 for two episodes. It was announced on 3 February 2013, that Robinson has returned to Casualty and would make his first appearance on 9 February 2013. He would be filling the gap left since Michael French's departure as Nick Jordan. Speaking of his return, Robinson said; "It's fantastic to be back! Recreating a character that has moved on and changed so much is incredibly challenging and this feels like a totally new job. But to be back working with Derek Thompson, I feel like I've come home." Executive producer, Jonathan Young added; "We're thrilled to have Patrick back. Ash was a hugely popular character and reuniting him with Charlie will reignite a friendship that we hope will delight viewers old and new. With many years of nursing under his belt plus a stint working as a doctor in America, Ash brings a unique perspective to the ED that will challenge Zoe but charm the rest of the team."
Ash joined the hospital as a staff nurse and was promoted to senior staff nurse in series 7. When Lisa "Duffy" Duffin (Cathy Shipton) left the hospital, Ash became the department's charge nurse. He was suspended from the hospital when a racist thug that threatened him with a knife accuses him of assault, but was acquitted when Matt Hawley (Jason Merrells) admits he overheard the man threatening Ash. Ash continued his role of charge nurse until his departure. Ash returned to the ED in 2013 as a locum consultant, who was eventually given a permanent place within the hospital.
During his original stint in the ED, Ash had friendships with Kelly Liddle (Adie Allen) and Charlie Fairhead (Thompson). He is devastated when Kelly comitts suicide and becomes Charlie's 'right-hand man'. When Ash returned to the ED in 2013, he renewed his friendship with Charlie, whilst also befriending clinical lead Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker) and later, staff nurse Rita Freeman (Chloe Howman). Ash has also been involved in several relationships. He was shown to be living with his girlfriend, Nikki Wyatt, in series 7, but they separated when she had an abortion. Ash was later shown to have feelings for his new flatmate Mie Nishi-Kawa (Naoko Mori), but she left Holby before their relationship could develop. Ash married the hospital's PR officer Laura Milburn (Lizzy McInnerny) in the series 10 finale and they left Holby together following this. During his 1998 return, Ash confirmed he and Laura had a daughter and were separated.
His 2013 return brought him into conflict with Zoe upon his return, but they later became friends. He quickly made an impression on his colleagues when he attended a motorbike crash on the way to his first shift. Zoe left Ash in charge of the emergency department when she became ill and he took to the challenge well. Ash's daughter, Ella Ashford (Tahirah Sharif) was introduced in April 2013 when she was admitted into the ED. Ash is shown to deeply love Ella, despite her troublemaking attitude. He does later recognise Ella's faults and begins punishing her for her irresponible actions. Ash later discovers that Ella had an affair with her maths teacher, resulting in his decision to have Ella stay with him permanently. Ella later steals ketamine from Ash's emergency medical equipment and when she shows no remorse for her actions, despite her boyfriend dying under the influence, Ash reports her to the police who arrested her.
Ash was assigned F2 doctor Lily Chao (Crystal Yu) as a mentee in August 2013 and becomes disgusted by her bedside manner. Ash warns Lily about her behaviour when she performs a life-threatening operation on a patient in cubicles. When a pregnant woman with down's syndrome is admitted, Lily and Ash are tasked with treating her. Lily becomes attached to the patient and performs another risky operation on her without permission. Ash is furious with her and informs her that that her patient died when she had, in fact, gone to the maternity ward. When she discovers the truth, Lily files a formal complaint against Ash and despite persuasion from Zoe to rethink her decision, she decides to make the complaint. They later attend a meeting with the hospital's CEO Guy Self (John Michie) who decides that Lily should not have performed the operation without the permission of Ash or Charlie and Ash is given a written warning for his behaviour.
Ash becomes a support for Rita when her paedophile husband is admitted into the ED, resulting in her to begin excessive drinking. When he discovers Rita drinking at work, he sends her home but is left with the choice of telling her boss the truth. Ash (along with colleagues Lily, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), Tess Bateman (Suzanne Packer) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford)) are involved in a road collision, where Ash becomes trapped in the vehicle. He insists his colleagues are to be saved before himself and following that, paramedics Jeff Collier (Matt Bardock) and Kathleen "Dixie" Dixon (Jane Hazlegrove) attempt to rescue him from the vehicle. They discover metal stuck in his leg which Jeff resolves to pull out in order to stop Ash from bleeding out. This allows Dixie and firemen to retrieve out of the vehicle, but as they get to the ambulance, the vehicle explodes with Jeff inside. Jeff's death began affecting Ash, who develops survivor's guilt which has serious effects on his work. Dixie blames Ash for Jeff's death and after a series of arguments, Dixie tells Ash that he should have died in the explosion and not Jeff. Ash continues to react angrily when a Jehovah's Witness refuses to receive a blood transfusion and when two teenagers constantly put themselves in danger. Ash's boss, Connie, demands he attend counselling which he doesn't enjoy. The counsellor, Ben Harding (Mark Letheren), suggests that Jeff chose to save Ash because he believed Ash was worth saving prompting him to turn his life around and honour Jeff's wishes by correctly doing his job. He also talks to Dixie who apologises for blaming Ash. However, Ben's words cause Ash to become obsessed with saving lives to honour Jeff and is eventually convinced to take leave from work. Off-screen, Ash chooses to resign from his job in order to concentrate on Ella who had been released from prison.
Lloyd Asike.
Lloyd Asike played by Michael Obiora is a staff nurse who first appeared on 20 August 2011, alongside Scarlett Conway (Madeleine Mantock). Lloyd and Scarlett's casting were revealed in an interview that "Digital Spy" published with executive producer, Oliver Kent on 6 July 2011. Lloyd left "Casualty" on 8 June 2013 after deciding to retrain as a doctor.
Upon his arrival, Lloyd was mentored by Jay Faldren (Ben Turner) and it slowly becomes clear that Lloyd has feelings for Scarlett and following the massive fire at the hospital, he admits his feelings to her and they begin a relationship. Their relationship ends abruptly when she hands herself in for throwing a brick at a police officer during the Holby Riots. His mum, Florence and sister, Shelia appear towards the end of series 26.
In an interview with "Digital Spy" in 2011, producer Oliver Kent announced the casting of Michael Obiora as Lloyd Asike. Obiora's casting was announced at the same time as Scarlett Conway (Madeleine Mantock). He said, "We're bringing in two new nurses at the start of the new series - Lloyd Asike and Scarlett Conway. We're very excited about the castings. Lloyd is played by the brilliant Michael Obiora, who viewers will probably know from "Hotel Babylon", "EastEnders" and "Grange Hill". He's phenomenal." In 2012, producer Nikki Harris spoke to "Inside Soap" about whether Lloyd was going to have a relationship with Scarlett. She said, "I couldn't possibly say yet - just keep watching! What's interesting about the pair of characters is the question of identity. Lloyd is from a very strong, cultural black background and is very rooted in his origins, whereas Scarlett was brought up in a white family. So we're really interested in exploring the two differences in indentity between the two."
B.
Mike Barratt.
Mike Barratt, played by Clive Mantle, made his first appearance during the seventh series. Mike was a consultant, who formed a relationship with staff nurse Rachel Longworth (Jane Gurnett). He became a popular member of the cast and was branded a "heart-throb". Mantle left at the end of series eleven, but briefly returned during the following series. Of his decision to leave the show, Mantle said "I didn't want to see the audience always expecting him to be there and perhaps taking less notice of him. I've had a great time, but I'm frightened that, if I stick around too long, I'll end up unable to do anything else." The character later appeared in sister show "Holby City" between 1999 and 2001, as a consultant general surgeon. Mantle reprised his role for the 30th anniversary episode "Too Old for This Shift", which aired in August 2016.
Tess Bateman.
Tess Bateman, played by Suzanne Packer, is a ward sister who first appeared on 13 September 2003. From her arrival until 2005, Tess was an emergency nurse practitioner and following that, she was promoted to clinical nurse manager for six years, until 2011. In May 2011, Tess resigned from her position and resumed the role of ward sister, but was later reinstated. Tess continued in the role until January 2015 when she resigned to help set up a new health centre as a secondment, returning as a ward sister shortly after. Packer chose to leave the role in 2015, with Tess departing on 22 August 2015. Tess left Holby to live in Leeds with her son and grandson. Packer reprised her role for the 30th anniversary episode "Too Old for This Shift", which aired in August 2016.
Connie Beauchamp.
Constance "Connie" Beauchamp played by Amanda Mealing, originally appeared in Casualty's spin off show, Holby City, in the role of Cardiothoracic Consultant and Clinical Lead of Holby's Darwin Cardiothoracic Ward. Connie later went on to become Director of Surgery and Medical Director of Holby City Hospital. During this period, she appeared in the first two crossovers between "Casualty" and "Holby City", featuring the casts of both shows, and made a guest appearance in the "Casualty" episode shown 9 September 2007. She departed from the show in its thirteenth series, resigning from her post. Her return was announced on 23 July 2013 and she arrived in Casualty on 29 March 2014.
Big Mac.
Mackenzie "Big Mac" Chalker played by Charles Dale first appeared on 24 November 2007. He was a porter until October 2013, when he applied to become an emergency care assistant. However, he quit this role in November 2014 and applied to be a healthcare assistant instead. He hasn't changed his job role since. Dale's departure was announced on 7 June 2016, after eight and a half years on the show. Big Mac's exit airs on 11 June 2016 when he decides to leave Holby. Dale since revealed he would return for a cameo appearance in the show's thirteith anniversary specials.
Big Mac is a veteran of the Falklands War of 1982, where many of his fellow soldiers were killed while he survived. This has led to him experiencing intense feelings of guilt. The BBC describe him as "overly sensitive" and "just a little bit grouchy". An episode of series 23 devoted to the character sees him assume a vigilante role on the city's Farmead Estate. Dale states that the episode causes Mac to realise: "it's time he stood up for himself and that he can't run from things that happened in the past all his life." Describing Mac's personality, Dale appraised that Mac is "deeply introverted" and struggles to accept that his colleagues actually like him. He explained that although Mac occasionally acts pompously, this approach is "a mask that he puts on to keep people at distance when he gets afraid or embarrassed". He expanded that Mac has: "been scared to go out and he's terrified of life. But because of people in the hospital he's slowly discovering it."
Mac has a budding friendship with Noel Garcia (Tony Marshall) and Louise Tyler (Azuka Oforka). When paramedic Dixie Dixon (Jane Hazlegrove) mentioned to Louise and Mac that they were looking for a new Emergency Care Assistant, Mac showed interest and Louise completed an application on Mac's behalf. Mac was given the job and spent a day training Max Walker (Jamie Davis) to be a porter in the ED. He has also supported paramedic Iain Dean through traumatic events.
In September 2012, Mac became the centre of a big storyline which saw him suffer a major heart attack. Mac survived the heart attack, and according to Dale, the storyline gave Mac "a new lease of life.". Later in March 2014, Mac was held hostage alongside Iain and attacked in the ambulance bay by one of Iain's army colleagues, Kenny Archer. Mac made a full recovery and returned to work. In October 2014, following the death Jeff Collier (Matt Bardock), Mac asks for a transfer back to the ED, where he becomes a healthcare assistant.
Noel was attacked in January 2016 and whilst the attack took place, Mac hid in a nearby toilet. Noel is left seriously injured, but recovers and is left under the impression that Mac fought the attacker off. Subsequently, Noel does various good gestures for Mac including buying Mac a new motorbike. Mac continues to live with the guilt of his cowardice, whilst the attacker Mercedes Christie (Hannah Spearitt) regularly visits Mac and blackmails him in return for drugs. The investigating officers discover the truth and Mac is publicly taken away for questioning, causing him to be remonstrated by several members of the ED staff. Noel discovers the truth and ends their friendship, moving out of their apartment. The two men bicker needlessly at work until Jack Diamond (Alistair Brammer) and Robyn Miller (Amanda Henderson) lock them in a room together. Mac explains that he panicked and now felt deeply ashamed about his actions. Noel forgives him and agrees to move back in.
Mac realises that Mercedes is a deeply troubled woman and is sympathetic towards her. When Mac loses his pain medication, he grows irritable and steals painkillers from a pharmacy order he is asked to make. Mercedes catches him doing so and steals the drugs for herself. When the pharmacy reports a stock inconsistency, the suspicion of theft is raised and Mac is unable to complete Mercedes' demands, causing him to feel trapped. He tearfully confesses everything to Noel, who promises to support him and scares Mercedes away from Mac, reminding her that she risks the custody of her child (Toby Murray). Mac is recommended to a support group, but he is too ashamed to attend and quickly re-offends, stealing a patient's tramadol tablets. Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) discovers this and when Mac breaks down and explains everything to Charlie, he offers to hide the drugs. Charlie hides the drugs in his locker, but an investigation into the missing drugs begins. Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths) discovers the drugs and reports her findings to clinical nurse manager, Rita Freeman (Chloe Howman), under the impression they belonged to Charlie. Charlie keeps his promise and is suspended, leaving Mac feeling guilty and Elle ostracised from the staff. Noel informs Mac that he knows they were Mac's drugs and orders him to tell the truth, but he avoids doing so.
Mac has a terrible day which sees him treat a girl who he discovers is being abused by her stepfather. The stepfather plays the victim by claiming that the girl is harassing him. When the truth is revealed about the abuse, the stepfather drags the girl out the ED, but Mac steps in and bravely takes a beating in order to protect her. Mac then confesses that he stole drugs and when Rita informs him he will be suspended, Mac decides to resign. He then says goodbye to his colleagues and leaves. Before he leaves, he attends a NA meeting with Charlie, where he relays his story and thanks Charlie for what he did, before leaving Holby.
C.
Alice Chantrey.
Alice Chantrey, played by Sam Grey, made her first appearance on 1 April 2006. Alice joined the series as a receptionist and she later trained as a healthcare assistant. Grey chose to leave the series in 2010 and departed on 1 May 2010. It was announced on 16 August 2016 that Alice would guest appear in the show on 27 August 2016 for the show's thirtieth anniversary celebrations.
It was announced on 3 February 2006 that Grey had been cast in the role. She said of her casting: "I'm really excited to be working with such skilled and talented actors on "Casualty". It's a great opportunity to learn more. At the moment my real nerves are helping me to play the part of Alice as she's an anxious character." Alice is described by the BBC as "cripplingly shy" and easily intimidated.
Alice is befriended by Sam Bateman, and develops a crush on senior house officer Guppy Sandhu. Alice goes as far as to pretend one of the porters is her boyfriend in an effort to draw his attention, however all this achieves is helping Sam realise he has feelings for her himself. When the department is threatened with closure, consultant Harry Harper opposes the move, and Clinical Manager Nathan Spencer persuades Alice to claim that he has sexually harassed her, in order to sabotage Harry's campaign. Realising she has been tricked, Alice drops her claim and expresses a wish to leave for the South American rain forest, but Sam persuades her to stay. Later in the series, Sam himself leaves to travel in Thailand. Alice kisses him before his departure, confessing her love for him.
Alice began a relationship with paramedic Curtis Cooper, which Grey described as "a bit of a slow burn", commenting: "They've been tiptoeing around each other for a while because they both have their own issues - Alice is a nervous character and very shy, while Curtis has a past, which he tries to keep back. Although they find it difficult to communicate they get on well and hit it off in the quirkiest way possible." She assessed that Alice was initially nervous of the relationship as: "She's very naive, quite like a little girl in many ways. She's never had a proper relationship and is still a virgin. Curtis knows all this about her and is very careful with her as a result." When Curtis is targeted by a local gang leader, Tony, he breaks up with Alice to protect her, as Tony threatens to kill her. When they later reunite, Alice is assaulted by Tony's girlfriend and admitted to the ED as a patient. She and Curtis become engaged, however on their wedding day, Alice is taken hostage at gunpoint on the hospital roof. Curtis tackles her assailant over the edge, and dies saving Alice. The "Daily Mirror"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Jim Shelley criticized Alice's relationship with Curtis, deeming it "about as convincing as Stacey Slater's with Bradley, or "Corrie"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Maria and Tyrone", lacking in plausibility as: "Alice had gone from being so virginal and meek she was practically mute to marrying a youth the police claimed used to be 'a serious player'."
Alice began to take a 'back-seat' role following the conclusion to her relationship with Curtis, appearing in few scenes per episode with minimal lines. Following the death of Adam Trueman's (Tristan Gemmill) son, he went on a downward spiral and had a one-night stand with Alice. He rejected her the following morning, devastating her. Alice remained concerned about Adam and having been hurt by Adam too many times, she gets a new job and decides to leave Holby City Hospital. Adam's ex-wife Jessica Harrison (Gillian Kearney) meets Alice before her departure, where Adam discovers them.
Lily Chao.
Lily Chao, played by Crystal Yu, is a registrar who first appeared on 3 August 2013. Lily had been through several years training from her arrival until August 2015. The BBC have described Lily as an intelligent, logical, high-achiever who comes from a hard-working family that like to boast about their doctor daughter, but have never really told her they are proud of her. In 2014, series producer Erika Hossington spoke to "Digital Spy" about a series of standalone episodes the show would produce, revealing that the first standalone would feature Lily, "The first one is a murder mystery and the character it features is Lily. That's been written by Jeff Povey. It's a great episode and it's all set at night. The hospital is empty, so it feels like a very ghostly place and that really feeds into the story that we're telling. It's brilliant and it feels very different."
Lofty Chiltern.
Ben "Lofty" Chiltern played by Lee Mead, is a staff nurse who first appeared on 1 March 2014. He was introduced as the nurse replacing Jamie Collier. His awkwardness and clumsiness are running gags, but he is also open, sympathetic and giving in nature, and possesses the bedside manner which some doctors in the ED lack. Lee Mead will be taking a break from casualty while he goes on tour till 18th September. However Mead will return later in the year.
The character of 'Lofty' and his casting of Lee Mead was announced on 19 September 2013, alongside Jamie Davis' casting in Max Walker. It was revealed that he was to play a 'likeable and popular nurse with a less-than-ordinary background'. Commenting on his role, Mead says: "I'm thrilled to be joining Casualty. I really enjoyed my guest appearance in 2011, but this will be a completely different challenge. When I first read about the character Lofty I didn't imagine I would be in the frame to play him. I am hoping he will charm audiences and they will get behind him. I can't wait to get started and to learn all of the medical jargon!" Oliver Kent, Casualty's Executive Producer, said: "As the character Lofty was being developed, we couldn't think of anyone else to better to play him. We can't wait to start filming and are thrilled to have Lee join the team. With a very different background to most of the other nurses, his clumsy charm is sure to win everyone over."
It was later revealed that Mead's casting as Lofty was inspired by Daniel Anthony's decision to leave the show as Jamie Collier. Describing Lofty as "the most adorable character", Oliver Kent believes that he will prove as popular as Abs. He continued to say that Mead is probably "the nicest guy in showbusiness; he has this completely ego-free quality that comes across in his performance." He also mentioned how the part of Lofty was written especially for Mead.
Mead described Lofty as "a cheeky chap! He's a nice bloke with good intentions, but he's also very lazy. Lofty has been living at home and he's kept telling his parents that he's going to get a job at some point and get his own place, but he just hasn't got round to it yet! He's a trained nurse, but he's just been enjoying taking money from his parents and going out drinking!" Mead also said how he loved the way his character had been introduced; "I thought it was quite fun and I knew from the start that this would be a very interesting character. Lofty brings a great energy to work with him. He's got quite a fun element to him and a positive outlook. Lofty is also quite clumsy, though - he often says the wrong thing and there's the odd occasion where he's falling over things!" Mead also revealed he was signed at Casualty for a year and hopes to stay for longer.
Lofty was first seen when climbing out of the loft of Robyn Miller's house, stealing one of Max Walker's shirts and £20 before going and ironing the shirt. Robyn returned home to find this man ironing the shirt. After he insisted he wasn't a burglar, she began to chase him to the garden and over the fence where she jumped on to a rake, impaling her foot. Lofty, who told Robyn his name was Nigel, helped Robyn and called 999. He stayed with her as she was admitted in the ED but missed his interview at St James' Hospital. He had left his wallet behind when he left to try and save his potential job and Robyn saw that his name was actually Ben Chiltern.
He returned, after feeling too guilty, and when questioned remained adamant that his name was Nigel. Robyn told Rita Freeman about him and her worries and she said that she would be happy to ring the police for her and advised that Robyn should let her do so. Robyn was about to until Lofty came clean and told him about everything, including his name and the interview. She accepts his apology and offers him a room at her house, to which he gladly accepts. Robyn also manages to get him a job at the ED, replacing Jamie. This pleases him and Robyn gives him the nickname, Lofty, due to him living in the loft of her house and when he tries to tell people his name is actually Ben, she gives up after failing to tell them. Robyn "mentors" him and shows him the ropes and they both work on the same cases often, until he settles in properly.
Lofty is suspended after Dixie Dixon ropes him into helping patient, Leo Wren (Charley Palmer-Marshall), see his dying mother. He is only suspended for a few weeks by Tess Bateman because he swapped round his shifts with Robyn so there was no shortage of staff. He sees the rush the ED were having from the news and goes into help the team voluntarily, leaving Tess relieved. After checking with charge nurse, Charlie Fairhead, Tess allows Lofty to return to work the following week.
In a Remembrance Day episode, Lofty is reluctant to buy a plastic poppy, and as a result falls out with former soldier Iain Dean. However, Lofty later wins the respect of the whole ED, including Iain, when a football hooligan sets off a flare in the hospital; Lofty nearly suffocates trying to save a young boy who can't escape the resulting smoke. The boy later dies of an unrecognised head injury, but Lofty is lauded as a hero.
Lofty comes under harsh criticism from Dylan Keogh for his clumsiness and perceived unprofessional and interfering nature. Lofty, who is generally well-liked, is distressed by this, but after Dylan appears to turn a corner with his mental illness, Lofty is very surprised to find himself appointed by Dylan to assist him on a regular basis.
When a Band 6 nursing position opens up at the ED, Lofty is initially unmotivated to apply, convinced he has no potential, and that his job is a dead-end one. He becomes so visibly despondent that Robyn rescinds her own application for the position- deciding he 'needs' the promotion more than she does- and Dylan uncharacteristically decides to encourage him, assuring him he has talent and putting his failings down to lack of assertiveness. Even after a decent interview, Rita the senior nurse is doubtful of his abilities, but her opinion of him transforms when he relieves an extremely overstretched ED by setting up and managing a triage tent outside the entrance. Rita assures him the very same day that he will be promoted. After he becomes the new lead nurse in band 6, Lofty begins to rethink his future as the leader in charge; new staff member, Diane who is an agency nurse arrives to help Lofty and Dylan with a patient who has been sleeping rough. When the patient crashes in the lift, Lofty accidentally electrocutes Diane when shocking the patient; Diane later dies from the electrocution and Lofty has to give a statement as to what happened. He is unsure as to whether he followed proper procedure, which compromises his position. His job is on the line for Diane's accidental death and he begins to blame himself, feeling guilty about letting Dylan down, who has been nothing but supportive to him since he considered a new job role as a band 6 nurse. Lofty ends up leaving in episode 27 series 30, unable to withstand the burden any longer. His last action in the ED is to talk Diane's grieving daughter out of a vent shaft where she is hiding, and he subsequently declares his intention to take some time off and then retrain as a bereavement counsellor.
Kirsty Clements.
Kirsty Clements, portrayed by Lucy Gaskell, first appeared on 15 May 2010. She is a senior staff nurse and replaced Jessica Harrison (Gillian Kearney). Gaskell's pregnancy in early 2011, coincided with her decision to leave "Casualty" and Kirsty departed on 30 July 2011.
Kirsty is a skilled Mental Health Nurse, but is often late to her shifts due to her abusive husband Warren and their teenage daughter Nita. Kirsty is somewhat of a maverick, believing strongly in bending the rules and going the extra mile to help a patient, leading to clashes with her more traditionalist boss Tess Bateman (Suzanne Packer). Kirsty helps Simone Lewis (Jayne Wisener), a patient left severely traumatised and with conversion disorder by the Holby College shooting, recover, despite threats from her mother (Michelle Collins). Kirsty grows close to consultant, Adam Trueman (Tristan Gemmill) after he invites her out for a drink, impressed by her role in the Simone Lewis case. Kirsty makes romantic advances towards Adam, which he rebuffs. Embarrassed, she flees, arriving home to find Warren waiting with her mobile phone, which he throws across the room.
Kirsty has trouble sleeping and takes diazapam. However, she is quickly woken by a phonecall from work - she has her shifts mixed up, and is already due in. Bruising can be seen on her back as she gets dressed. The drug begins to take effect during her shift and she tricks Adam into prescribing ritalin to counteract the effects. However, she reacts badly and collapses in the shower, leaving Adam and Mads to secretly restart her heart. Adam holds Kirsty's hand as she finally gets some sleep in the on-call room. Warren collects her from the hospital. Adam later notices bruises on Kirsty's arms. Kirsty returns home mid-shift to check on Warren, who seems to be suffering from myalgic encephalomyelitis, leaving him unable to work. It also appears the bruises come from helping her husband to stand up. However, when she tries to go back to work, Warren hides her car keys. She borrows Adam's car to take Nita to school. When Adam raises his voice at Kirsty in jest, she breaks down.
Warren and Nita are involved in a car crash, which leaves them with superficial injuries. Warren becomes aware of the tension between Kirsty and Adam. Uncomfortable, Adam shies away from further intimacy with Kirsty. Warren later arrives in the ED having fainted and Nita tells Kirsty that he was smashing up her belongings. Adam comforts Kirsty and they kiss. Warren is diagnosed with Muscular dystrophy and Kirsty decides to stand by him. Warren discovers an apologetic text sent to Adam on Kirsty's phone and he beats her. Kirsty rejects her colleague's sympathy and kind words about Warren's diagnosis. She is particularly awkward with Adam and struggles to work with him. She eventually accepts a lift home and a Christmas gift from him.
Warren beats Kirsty again and she arranges to have an X-ray taken. Adam discovers the results and confronts Kirsty about Warren's abuse. She tells him the truth and lets him examine her injuries. Later, Warren arrives at the ED with flowers for Kirsty, who is busy treating a patient. Adam takes the flowers and hints that he knows what has been going on. Adam warns Kirsty of Warren's visit and she panics. Adam suggests that Kirsty and Nita leave Warren and stay with him, but she returns home and Warren beats her again.
Warren buys Kirsty a pair of bowling shoes for their wedding anniversary and suggests they go bowling like they used to when they were teenagers. Kirsty agrees and calls in sick to work but their day out turns sour when a worried Adam calls to check up on Kirsty. They return home and tension mounts when Adam turns up at the front door, warning Kirsty that Warren will "cross the line". Warren is furious, and terrified of what is coming sends Nita upstairs where distraught, she listens to her father beat her mother. Bleeding heavily, Kirsty flees to Adam's house; Warren has crossed the line. The next morning, Adam checks the spare room to find Kirsty has gone. She has returned home where she lies awake next to Nita, planning to leave Warren for good. She digs out hers and Nita's passports but is forced to hide them in the bookshelf when Warren comes downstairs and forces her to promise never to leave him again. Kirsty falsely promises and goes to work as normal, planning to return to pack their things and leave that afternoon, when Warren has a physiotherapy appointment. Knowing she has to wait for Warren to leave, she hangs around, subtly saying goodbye to her colleagues, complimenting Tess, hugging Jay for a little too long and slipping a note (reading "Thank you, I could never have done it without you x") into Adam's pocket. Later, she hits her head on the monitor, opening up her wound from the previous night. Tess insists she go home. She rings Nita to tell her to prepare to go, but Adam overhears the phone call and confronts her; they say an emotional goodbye. Kirsty returns home to pack but is terrified when she finds the passports have been found by Warren, who returns home and catches her packing. She takes the beating. Adam receives a phone call from Kirsty, but when he picks up a vicious Warren is on the other end. He rushes over, fearing the worst, to find Kirsty alive but Warren in a deep coma at the bottom of the stairs with Nita at his side.
Three weeks later, Warren comes round. His mother is visiting and reveals to Kirsty that she has known about the abuse all along, but tells Kirsty she must stay with her husband because he is "a good man". She retorts that "good men don't beat their wives." Warren's mother sees Adam comforting Kirsty and jumps to conclusions before telling Warren that Kirsty is having an affair. Warren then goes missing from his bed and is eventually discovered close to collapse in the toilets by Kirsty. She rushes to help him but he verbally assaults her and punches her in the face. This is the final straw and she finally finds the strength to leave, leaving him collapsed. Outside with Nita, she is oblivious Warren is found with a massive DVT and dies, unable to be resuscitated by the team. Adam catches Nita and Kirsty as they are about to leave and delivers the news.
The new joint clinical lead, Miriam Turner (Cheryl Campbell), was the doctor who treated Kirsty's daughter Nita when she was born. After discovering Warren's first attack on Kirsty, Miriam warned Kirsty to leave Warren as he will attack her again. Upon her return to the ED, Miriam asks Kirsty if she ever did leave Warren to which Kirsty tells her about how the violence got worse but he died weeks before. She tells Kirsty that at least he can't hurt her anymore. Kirsty then leaves the ED and is last seen driving into Wales with Nita before throwing her wedding ring into the sea.
Maggie Coldwell.
Maggie started off her career in medicine as a nurse, before retraining to become a doctor. She is highly competent, although has been held back from progressing further up the career ladder as a result of a tendency to be too outspoken with hospital management, most notably clashing frequently with Nathan Spencer. She successfully applied for the role of consultant, before Nathan claimed there was no funding to pay her post.

Jeff Collier.
Jeff Collier played by Matt Bardock, is an intelligent paramedic and the main protagonist & hero of the series who first appeared on 10 February 2007. It was announced on 30 June 2014, that Jeff would be leaving later in the year after seven years on the show. Jeff left after being killed in an accident, where he saves the life of Martin Ashford (Patrick Robinson), on 4 October 2014. This led to the exit of Tamzin Bayle (Gemma Atkinson), the permanent return of Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) and the guest appearance of Jamie Collier (Daniel Anthony).
Jeff becomes good friends with Dixie upon his arrival, and when she is told budgetary constraints mean one of her team must be transferred, Jeff volunteers to go. He returns several months later, following the departure of Cyd Pyke. He discovers that fellow paramedic Snezana Lalovic (Ivana Bašić) is stealing hospital equipment to help illegal Serbian immigrants, and reluctantly agrees to keep it a secret when she swears not to do it again.
In November 2009, Jeff was struck on the back of the head by Alistair MacCormack (Joe McFadden), who believed that Polly Emmerson (Sophia Di Martino), who he deludedly regarded as his "girlfriend", was seeing Jeff. Alistair also thought that Jeff had got a restraining order against him, but it was really Polly, who had reported Alistair to the police. Jeff was admitted to the ED.
During a call to a college shooting, Jeff witnesses the death of a student that leaves him suffering post-traumatic stress and threatened his job. He was told that would either need to return at work during the week or have to leave his job. He got some help and returned to work.
Jeff's wife, Lucy, leaves him after finding love with another man. He sees his children very infrequently. In between part 1 and part 2 of the Holby Riots, Dixie & Jeff were in a red button special which sees Dixie encourage Jeff to speak to his children again. In need of a lodger, Jeff searches for someone to move in and when Dixie's house is burnt down, she moves in with Jeff. Dixie asks Jeff to marry her, to make her father proud.

They agree to go out on a date, Samantha is revealed to be married and stabs her husband accidentally when he finds her and Jeff in bed. She attempts to blame Jeff but her lies are discovered and she is arrested by the police. Tamzin later reveals that she had called off her wedding.
When his colleagues, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), Tess Bateman (Suzanne Packer), Martin Ashford (Patrick Robinson), Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford) and Lily Chao (Crystal Yu) are involved in a car crash, Jeff and Dixie arrive to help, successfully saving their colleagues. Meanwhile, Jeff tells his wife Dixie that he wants a divorce because, upon their return to the ED. In order to save Ash from bleeding out, he forcibly pulls out a piece of metal from his leg, allowing Dixie and the firemen to pull him out and carry him to the ambulance. Before Jeff can exit the vehicle, it explodes, killing him instantly as a horrified Ash and Dixie watch on.
"Inside Soap" described Jeff and Dixie as the 'dynamic duo'. In an interview with "Inside Soap", producer Nikki Harris teased what was next for the two saying, "Dixie and Jeff were central to our opening episodes in Cardiff, as they really came under pressure with the car crash and the explosion that happened on the estate. And as we look at how the police interact with ED later on, the paramedics are going to be on the front line in terms of that, because they're sort of in between each side. So Jeff and Dixie are set to have key roles in those storylines when they play out on screen."
On 28 March 2014, it was announced Michelle Collins would join the cast as Samantha Keeler, the love interest of Jeff. It was revealed that as the romance with Jeff blossoms, a secret held by Samantha threatens to turn both of their worlds upside down. Casualty's executive producer Oliver Kent said: "We can't wait for everyone to meet Samantha and see where her story goes over the two months she's on screen. Michelle has been absolutely brilliant and her arrival is set to have a huge impact on one of the show's most loved characters."
On 30 June 2014, it was announced that Bardock would be leaving his role as Jeff after seven years in the role and that Jeff would depart on-screen in late 2014, after the conclusion of his new love interest storyline with Samantha Keeler. Executive producer, Oliver Kent spoke about Bardock's departure; "Matt Bardock has given us one of Casualty's all-time favourite characters and we are sad to see him go. Jeff Collier has been an iconic action hero for seven years and we have been so lucky to have had him on our team for so long. We wish him all the very best for the future." Bardock spoke about his exit from the programme on "Twitter" after receiving several messages from fans. He tweeted that he was overwhelmed with all the lovely comments and then thanked his fans for the 'love and support' for Jeff. He said it was a real 'gas' for seven years.
D.
Toby De Silva.
Toby De Silva, portrayed by Matthew Needham, made his first appearance on 8 September 2007. Toby is a doctor who has just graduated from medical school. As an only child whose parents are in the medical profession, Toby was pushed into medicine.
On his first day on the show, we saw his lack of confidence which earned him the nickname Dracula. After making lots of mistakes and messing up an injection on a patient in front of his mother, Professor Camille Windsor, he decided to resign. Adam Trueman decided to give Toby another chance to prove himself by giving him a tricky procedure to do. After completing the procedure successfully, he decided to stay.
Since then Toby became more and more confident at his job and at Christmas 2007, he kissed Maggie under the mistletoe for a pound. She offered him her spare room, which he accepted, becoming her lodger. On 2 February 2008, Toby and Abs Denham found Ruth had hanged herself in her room. Toby found it hard to cope being the only F2 around and only just managed to complete a complicated procedure to save a girl's life.
After Ruth's attempted suicide, Toby got drunk at a pub with Maggie's pregnant daughter, Joanne. When she went into labour, he was forced to deliver the baby himself. The birth was successful and Toby and Joanne have since become lovers. Toby took a job in Orthopaedics with Sean Anderson as his boss. He was furious to discover Maggie had expressed serious doubts about his ability to do the job.
In November 2008, Toby discovered Ruth had spent the night with new Clinical Lead Nick Jordan and told her that Jordan was using her for a night of sex, not the whirlwind romance she believed was happening. She refused to believe him, saying that he was only saying that as he'd always fancied her. Later on, Toby went for a drink with new medical counsellor, Ben Harding, to discuss his feelings about Ruth but she found him in bed with Ben later that night which was the start of many problems to come.
Toby withdrew his statement and after arguing with Ben, embarrassed himself at the Christmas party with drink in hand. He threw away his NHS id badge but then realised he needed it to get his belongings back. He saw it and jumped into a boat, trying to retrieve it, but his foot went through the wood. He nearly drowned but luckily Toby was rescued and taken to casualty. He told his father that he was gay and told Mr Jordan that he wanted to quit immediately rather than serve his notice. This plan was derailed, following a rush of patients following a train crash, Mr Jordan said he could quit at the end of the shift. Toby was the only one able to deal with a young girl who was refusing treatment. Saying goodbye to Ruth, he tricked her telling there was a spider on her head which made her close her eyes. He took the opportunity to kiss her on the cheek before leaving. As he walked through the ED he received hugs and smiles from his co-workers. Outside, due to Toby's father, Ben met him and they walked out of the ED carpark with promises of coffee.
Toby made a brief reappearance at the end of episode 3 of series 24 when he is seen to openly kiss the medical counsellor, Ben Harding and then they both head into the pub to join the rest of the team from the just-finished shift. He is welcomed with open arms by his ex-colleagues and offers some friendly advice to the new F2 doctors.
Iain Dean.
Iain Dean, played by Michael Stevenson, first appeared in the red-button special "Under Fire", credited as Corporal Dean. Iain was introduced as a former army colleague of Sam Nicholls who he had an affair with in Afghanistan. Iain made a "Casualty" debut on 28 April 2012 for one episode. Stevenson returned to "Casualty" in April 2013 on a six-month contract, with Iain returning on-screen on 31 August. Iain's return saw him join the paramedic team as a student paramedic. Stevenson's contract ended in autumn 2013 and Iain's exit scenes aired on 22 March 2014. It was announced on 19 May 2014 that Stevenson had returned to "Casualty" as a regular character and that Iain's return scenes would air in the sixth episode of series 29. These scenes aired on 11 October.
Iain first appears in the red-button special "Under Fire" as the army colleague of Sam Nicholls. The special explores their relationship and the work they do in Afghanistan. When Iain appears in "Casualty", he is seen to give evidence at the hearing of Sam, after she restrained a patient from attacking Dylan Keogh. Iain is not seen again following his brief appearance at court until August 2013. Iain returns as the new student paramedic, working alongside Dixie Dixon and Jeff Collier. It becomes clear to the pair that Iain is overly confident and will need to be kept in line. He continues to try and prove himself to Jeff and Dixie, but receives backlash when he fortunately manages to rescue a woman from a bus crash seconds before it exploded.
Iain returned on 6 October 2014, following news that Jeff had died in an explosion. He immediately returned for his funeral and helped Dixie grieve. A struggling Dixie decided to work instead of go to Jeff's funeral and in a bid to change her mind, Iain decides to go with her. They successfully help a homeless man who has been dumped in landfill. Iain talks to Dixie and they rush to the funeral, where they are in time for Dixie's reading. Iain arrives at the wake to celebrate Jeff's life. He follows Dixie and Tamzin Bayle to the ambulance shelter where Tamzin reveals she is leaving Holby following the wake. Following this, Dixie offers Iain his old job as a paramedic. He accepts with delight.
In October 2015 Iain begins a relationship with Rita Freeman after a one-night stand.
In March 2014, Stevenson spoke of how "lucky" he felt to have been able to have multiple stories, having only been introduced as part of one storyline, "I’ve been dead lucky. I went in to serve one storyline and ended up with stories of my own! I’ve been so lucky to come straight into the love story with Sam and then for this other storyline to develop." He also went on to speak of how he was aware of Iain's history upon his casting as well as how his character was not intended to be as central as he was. In August 2014, series producer Erika Hossington discussed Iain's return with "Digital Spy", "We will see the return of Michael Stevenson as paramedic Iain, and he's coming back into the show as a regular character. It's going to be fun establishing his partnership with Dixie, and especially seeing how Dixie copes with the change after she and Jeff were such a strong team."
Abs Denham.
John "Abs" Denham, portrayed by James Redmond, made his first appearance on 4 October 2003. Denham chose to leave the role in 2008, with Abs departing the show on 18 October 2008, after five years on-screen. It was announced on 16 August 2016 that Abs would guest appear in the show on 27 August 2016 for the show's thirtieth anniversary celebrations.
Abs' first day at work was particularly memorable. He discovered that an escaped psychiatric patient had stolen his identity and was posing as him within the Emergency Department. Although the impostor successfully fooled Clinical Nurse Manager Tess Bateman (Suzanne Packer), the matter was eventually sorted out and the genuine Abs was able to start doing his job.
Abs entered into a short lived marriage with Ellen Zitek (Georgina Bouzova), the half-sister of his love interest Nina Farr (Rebekah Gibbs). Ellen lied to him over the course of many months about the danger she faced in her home country, and Abs agreed to get married simply to help her get a visa. It eventually became clear however, that Ellen's motives had not been genuine, and she was acting simply out of malice toward Nina. She left for a short period, during which Abs reunited with Nina - however, they were soon harassed by a loan shark to whom Ellen owed £15,000. Abs struggled to keep up with the payments, and not only got beaten up but had items repossessed. However, after being beaten up himself, the loan shark was fatally injured and Abs was free of Ellen's debt. Immigration officials also informed him that they would not be investigating his marriage to Ellen any longer, leaving him free to enjoy his time with Nina.
Once Ellen returned, Abs demanded a divorce. However, she soon revealed she was suffering from cancer, and although both Abs and Nina supported her throughout, several months later she was killed in an unrelated incident, run down by a motorbike, leaving Abs a widower. His relationship with Nina disintegrated during this period, with him first reacting poorly to the revelation she had once had relationships with women and identified as bisexual. He then became jealous of her relationship with Greg Fallon (Kip Gamblin), and eventually Nina decided to leave Holby.
In a special Comic Relief episode written by Richard Curtis, Abs was participating in a sleep-a-thon and was taken hostage by Megan Roach's (Brenda Fricker) grandson who crashed his camper van. Abs was unhurt but for a minor cut on his head. He was shot on New Year's Eve 2007 while out at a night club with Kelsey Phillips (Janine Mellor) but he escaped with just a minor injury to his arm. In protest of Charlie Fairhead's (Derek Thompson) redundancy, he called an unofficial work-to-rule, but after a patient died as a result, he realised he'd taken things too far and called it off. In March 2008, Abs attended his brother's funeral. At the funeral, he was reunited with his old friend Stacey. However, when his friend's drunken behaviour ended in a violent punch-up, Abs was forced to talk to Stacey about the dangers of alcoholism. Later, he revealed to his mother that he wanted to open up a clinic to treat alcoholism.

The character was first previewed in the 2015 autumn trailer, which was released on 18 September 2015, where a receptionist character called Jack was revealed. Brammer's casting was announced by executive producer Oliver Kent in an interview with "Radio Times", where he billed Jack as "flamboyant and outrageous and waspish". Brammer confirmed on "Twitter" that he was only contracted on the show for six months and he left after appearing in fifteen episodes.
Dixie Dixon.

She returned on 30 August 2014, at the beginning of series 29. On 5 May 2015, Dixie made a guest appearance in "Holby City" on the AAU ward, where she reunites with Adrian Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw) and helps him with his ongoing issues. It was announced in January 2016 that Hazlegrove had left her role of Dixie after almost 10 years with her final scenes airing on 30 January 2016.
She first appeared as a paramedic having transferred from another hospital alongside close friend, Cyd Pyke. When senior paramedic Josh Griffiths takes a six-month sabbatical to travel the world, Dixie becomes Operational Duty Officer. She forges a friendship with new recruit, Jeff Collier, to whom she admits she is a lesbian. Believing Cyd's life is in danger, following a venomous snake bite, Dixie confesses her love for her friend. When Cyd recovers, their friendship is strained by this and she transfers to another hospital. In series 23, Dixie accidentally runs a girl over whilst driving the ambulance. Dixie requires counselling after the accident. The victim's family burn her house down in revenge, and she moves in with Jeff. Dixie asks Jeff to marry her, to make her father proud as he is unaware she is a lesbian. Her father, who is on his deathbed, catches Dixie kissing another woman and suffers a heart attack.
In between part 1 and part 2 of the final two episodes of Series 26, Dixie & Jeff were in a red button special which saw Dixie encourage Jeff to speak to his children again. In 2013, following the prison riots, Dixie becomes romantically involved with Carol Walcott, the prison officer. They begin a relationship but Dixie later finishes it. Weeks later, they reunite but Dixie doesn't want to tell Jeff. Dixie drops Carol off at a meeting and promises her that she will tell Jeff. While Carol is at the meeting, she falls and hurts her arm and head. She does not tell anyone she has hurt her head though. She gets treated and Zoe Hanna and Tess Bateman pick up on their romance. While being taken up to x-ray, Carol collapses, begins to slur words and vomit. She is revealed to have had a serious brain injury. Dixie tells Jeff about Carol and he tells her that he will always be there for her. Dixie then comes into the ED to find Carol and Zoe informs Dixie that Carol died on the way up to theatre. Dixie is full of grief and in shock. She locks herself in her office but confides in Rita Freeman and later Jeff.
In April 2014, a patient is admitted to the ED after becoming involved in a motorbike crash. Dixie bonds with the patient, who is later revealed to be called Leo Wren, and helps him when he discovers that he could have his leg amputated. He later begins to recover slowly. Upon discovering his mother is dying, Dixie sets out on a mission to reunite them before her death, despite knowing the consequences for this. Max Walker helps Leo escape the hospital to the camper van Dixie has borrowed from a patient. Lofty goes with Dixie & Leo to collect his mum, Scarlet (Amanda Ryan) from the place she is staying. Her carer initially insists she would like to stay in her room and she confirms this when she appears. Despite what she originally decided, Scarlet later decides to go to the beach with Leo, Dixie & Lofty. Her carer also comes with them and is constantly worrying about her but Dixie tells him to relax and enjoy the beach. Scarlet goes waterskiing and then enjoys herself on the beach with Leo. They share memories and he is left devastated when they have to return to the hospital. On their journey back to the hospital, Leo starts to suffer pain and upon their arrival in the hospital, he is straight away sent to resus. Meanwhile, Lofty is told off by Charlie Fairhead and Tess but is let off because he swapped his shifts with Robyn Miller. Dixie, however, is told by Zoe that she will be sanctioned for her actions. The following week, Dixie is seen discussing her upcoming meeting which decides her future as a paramedic with Jeff, Max, Louise Tyler, Noel Garcia & Big Mac. Big Mac later suggests they role play the meeting to which Jeff thinks is stupid but Dixie likes the idea and they go through with it. While on her way to the meeting, she spots someone in need of help after they fell onto a metal spike. She leaves for her meeting as soon as Jeff & Big Mac arrive and is very late. The ambulance trust suspend Dixie for three months and everyone says goodbye to her in the pub later on.
Dixie returned on 30 August 2014 in the middle of Jeff's struggles with his girlfriend, Samantha Keelman (Michelle Collins) after her husband discovered that they were seeing each other. Following Samantha's arrest and departure, Jeff asks Dixie for a divorce, which he intends to do after they return to the ED following a car crash involving Connie, Ash, Tess, Ethan and Lily. After saving Ash's life, the car explodes immediately killing Jeff as a horrified Dixie watches on helplessly. She returns to the ED alone and tells everyone of Jeff's fate. Tamzin begs Dixie to go and get Jeff but failed, before breaking down in her arms. Dixie and Iain's working relationship encounters some problems; the two fall out after Iain repeatedly puts himself in harms way to save patients, which following Jeff's accident, Dixie finds unacceptable. Meanwhile, she continues in her efforts to adopt a baby. Unfortunately, the adoption committee adjudged that she was still mourning Jeff and thus had emotional difficulties, and her application was refused.
Dixie's latest storyline began airing October 2015, which saw her meet paramedic Jess Cranham (Kerry Bennett) whilst taking part in a HART training course. However, a new dimension was added to the storyline when Jess was later found down the bottom off a deep hole in the middle of woodlands. Her partner, Nikki Chisom (Anna Acton) is present along with Jess's daughter, Olivia (Grace Doherty), at the time of the incident, causing Dixie to become concerned for the welfare and safety of Jess and Olivia. Dixie is later reported by Jess after interfering in their relationship. Hossington revealed that Dixie would play a major role in a domestic abuse storyline, which will climax on 9 January 2016 where events take a dark and potentially deadly turn.
"Inside Soap" described Dixie and Jeff as the 'dynamic duo'. In an interview with "Inside Soap", producer Nikki Harris teased what was next for the two saying, "Dixie and Jeff were central to our opening episodes in Cardiff, as they really came under pressure with the car crash and the explosion that happened on the estate. And as we look at how the police interact with ED later on, the paramedics are going to be on the front line in terms of that, because they're sort of in between each side. So Jeff and Dixie are set to have key roles in those storylines when they play out on screen." In 2014, series producer Erika Hossington spoke to "Digital Spy" about the future plans for Dixie, saying that she and Jeff would be at the focus before his departure, "The other main characters we'll be focusing on over the next few months are Jeff and Dixie. I know the fans are really keen to know whether Dixie returns from her suspension before Jeff leaves, and I can confirm that she does - it would have been a huge letdown to the audience if she hadn't!" Hossington continued to say that following Jeff's departure that Dixie would establish a partnership with Iain, "It's going to be fun establishing Iain's partnership with Dixie, and especially seeing how Dixie copes with the change after she and Jeff were such a strong team."
Lisa Duffin.
Lisa "Duffy" Duffin, played by Cathy Shipton, was one of the show's original characters. Shipton remained on the show until December 1993, but returned for a guest appearance in February 1998.

Her storylines included being raped, her relationship and later marriage to Andrew Bower (William Gaminara/Philip Bretherton), an affair with Max Gallagher (Robert Gwilym) and her long-standing enduring friendship with Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson).
Duffy is first seen in Series 1 as a friendly and youthful nurse, but whose passion for her profession is demonstrated through her strong determination to keep the night shift open at the hospital. Her confidence drops when she is raped. In Series 2, her rapist is admitted to casualty and dies. Also in this series, Duffy enjoys a relationship with Peter Tranter (Eric Deacon), but breaks up with him after discovering he has HIV.

Her child, Peter, is born before the beginning of series 5, and she struggles to be a single mother for her son, even bringing him into work on one occasion, and relying on her mother Kate's (Doreen Mantle) assistance.
Her firm commitment to her role is highlighted in series 6.

In the New Year, she is annoyed that she had not known that Andrew would be returning to the hospital as a locum. When Andrew returns, he picks up Peter, initially unaware that he is his son. Later, Duffy and Andrew get back together, and on the last episode of series 7, the controversial episode "Boiling Point", she reveals to her colleagues that they will be getting married in the morning.

After nurse Mark Grace (Paterson Joseph) is seriously injured in a car accident at the beginning of series 13, Charlie gets in touch with Duffy hoping for her to come back to the hospital, despite Ward Sister Eve Montgomery's (Barbara Marten) reservations. Duffy returns in episode 4, initially as an agency nurse, before securing a full-time position. During the series, her marriage is on the rocks; Andrew has been having an affair.
In series 14, bed manager Adam Osman (Pal Aron) is applying for a nursing position, but, after discovering he is HIV positive, is faced with lukewarm support from Duffy, following her own experiences of the virus in the past. Duffy grows closer to consultant Max Gallagher (Robert Gwilym), after asking him to fix her car. When Eve leaves, the Sister post becomes vacant. Duffy decides to apply and before her interview Charlie warns Max not to be biased towards her. In the interview itself, Max is deliberately hard on her, which both Charlie and Duffy pick up on. She later questions Max on this, who admits he was in fact biased towards her, but did not want Charlie to think there was something between them. They kiss, unaware Charlie is watching them. Charlie is off with them both, and Duffy tells Andrew she is having to work late when Max asks her round for the night. Max later offers her concert tickets. Duffy realises Charlie knows about their affair, but is angry when he criticises her. Nevertheless, she declines Max's invitation to the concert. When Max asks her out for drinks, she decides to end their fling, concerned about her family. However, later she is irritated when she discovers Max is dating nurse Tina Seabrook (Claire Goose). Duffy also falls out with new registrar Patrick Spiller (Ian Kelsey), whose arrogant attitude aggravates the staff.
At the beginning of series 15, Duffy struggles to lead the department, following Charlie's pulmonary embolism at the end of the previous series. In November 2000, she returns from a weekend away with Andrew (now played by Philip Bretherton) who has told her that he will be joining the department as a locum. Duffy confronts Max about why he did not tell her sooner, and fears that the three of them working together may be difficult. Later, it is Duffy's 40th birthday, and Charlie leads the staff's celebrations. Andrew begins work at the department, and Duffy continues to be uneasy about his presence. She then finds out that she is pregnant, and confides in fellow nurse Colette Kierney (Adjoa Andoh). She is not keen for another child and fears Andrew's reaction. However, after he treats a pregnant woman, Duffy decides to tell him. He does not react positively, though, and relations between the two deteriorate. At one point they argue and Duffy asks Andrew if he wants her to have an abortion. She then is found by Colette in the toilets, bleeding and fearing she is having a miscarriage. She is admitted, and Andrew shows his support for both his wife and unborn child. She discovers from Charlie that Andrew has rejected a permanent consultancy at Holby - Andrew justifies it, saying he prioritises his marriage over his job. The couple's relationship thaws and they are both very happy. Duffy persuades Andrew to accept the consultancy and leaves to go on maternity leave. At the end of the series, anaesthetist Tom Harvey (Kieran Forsyth), who has taken senior house officer Holly Miles (Sandra Huggett) prisoner, bumps into Andrew in the hospital car park and pushes him down some steps. Andrew dies in resus, and Duffy is informed by Charlie about what has happened. Her cries are heard throughout the department.
Charlie visits widowed Duffy in the first episode of series 16, when she goes into labour. She will not go to hospital because Andrew died there. A few weeks later, she comes in with her new son, Paul. When she returns to work, she is annoyed at the changes Colette has made in her absence and at the fact that she did not know that Charlie was dating CEO Jan Goddard (Judy Loe). She struggles to cope as a single mother to three children, still devastated by Andrew's death.
At the beginning of series 17, Duffy is upset to discover she has received a life policy cheque because of Andrew's death. However, Charlie encourages her to take it, for her children's sake. Duffy clashes with locum SHO Heather Lincoln (Nicole Faraday) and is supportive of imprisoned SHO Lara Stone (Christine Stephen-Daly). Duffy's mother Kate (now played by Rosalind Knight) has breast cancer and later dies. Duffy finds comfort in new security guard Ryan Johnson (Russell Boulter). Ryan begins courting Duffy and they kiss. Word of their new relationship spreads around the department. Before Christmas 2002, Duffy ask Ryan to move in with her. In the New Year, they are thinking of going into business together and Ryan proposes to her, which she later accepts. Ryan later ploughs ahead with the business and Duffy agrees to write a cheque to him. Duffy hands in her resignation and the staff bid her farewell the week after, Charlie declaring her to be the "queen of the cubicles". Colette takes over her job. Ryan goes missing and when questioned by police, Duffy realises she does not know very much about her fiancé. She later finds he has emptied their joint bank account. She is forced to put her house on the market and takes on agency work. When she is unable to find a home, Charlie offers to house her and her sons. In April 2003, Ryan returns. Duffy is livid when she sees him, but he pleads with her. While admitting that he is a con man, he says that he loves her. He desperately tries to win Duffy back, and eventually she realises that she still loves him. She agrees to leave with him for a second time, on the condition that this is his last chance, and everything they own is signed in her name only. Charlie clearly feels that Duffy is making the wrong move, but they make up and she kisses him before she leaves for New Zealand.
Duffy next appears in the opening two episodes of series 21, in 2006, as part of Casualty's 20th anniversary celebrations. Charlie, paramedic Comfort Jones (Martina Laird), nurse John "Abs" Denham (James Redmond) and SHO Gurpreet "Guppy" Sandhu (Elyes Gabel) head to Cambodia where Duffy has set up a clinic for local people. Charlie does not take to her new partner Mike Hornsey (John Bowe) especially when he refuses to carry out an operation, claiming he has had a drink. When Charlie rings back to the UK to check up on Mike's background, he discovers that he had been struck off, but later Mike tells Charlie and Guppy that he was struck off because he helped his mother die. Duffy is upset that Charlie went behind her back, but they eventually make up.
Duffy is not seen again until the opening two episodes of series 30, which were especially written by Casualty co-creator Paul Unwin. She moves back to the UK from New Zealand and takes up a position as an agency nurse, her children now having grown up. Her first placement happens to be at Holby City, where none of the staff know who she is. She is horrified that the first time she sees Charlie again he has collapsed with a heart attack, caused by his rescuing Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker) from drowning in freezing water. She finds it difficult to concentrate on her work as her old friend repeatedly undergoes CPR, which is eventually successful. The next morning she visits Charlie on the ward and sees his son Louis (Gregory Foreman) again. In his dazed state while he suffered his heart attack, Charlie thought Duffy was the "angel of death". Also in her brief return to the hospital, she is instrumental in encouraging former nurse-turned-receptionist Louise Tyler (Azuka Oforka) to return to the profession.
Duffy returned in June 2016, working as an agency midwife at Holby City. Duffy was called to the ED by Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths) to help a pregnant lady with a serious clot in her lung. Duffy reconciled with Charlie and Louise, reassuring the latter that she could work with pregnant ladies again. She appeared again for Charlie's party to celebrate thirty years of working at the hospital. She stays to help when a helicopter crashes into the ED reception. Duffy decided to accept an offer to work in the emergency department as a sister following a shift working as an agency nurse.
Development and reception.
Shipton was cast in the role of staff nurse Duffy, having originally been considered for the role of receptionist Susie Mercier. Shipton revealed in 2016 that upon receiving the job, she was "flying about, doing the job, learning and lines and trying not to bump into the furniture". Shipton revealed that "in the early days" of appearing on the show, many young children would recognise her in the supermarket because of her portrayal of Duffy. She also stated that a nurse working on the show told her that she became a nurse because of her portrayl of the character. It was announced on 24 August 2015 that Shipton had reprised her role of Duffy, nine years following her previous appearance. Duffy returned in a "two-part story" written and directed by "Casualty" co-creator Paul Unwin in September 2015. Shipton said she was "surprised and delighted" to be reprise her role and described the scenes as "tear-jerkers". Shipton added that she was "proud to be playing Duffy again" because Duffy "seems to have a real and lasting connection with the public." Series producer Erika Hossington said the show "loved having her [Shipton] back" and hinted that fans should "watch this space", following her guest appearance. It was confirmed on 12 March 2016, in the Spring trailer, that Shipton had reprised her role again, but it was unconfirmed whether she would be joining the main cast.
The show celebrated its thousandth episode in June 2016, which saw Shipton return for a further guest appearance. Duffy's appearance saw her reveal that she had left her husband and was working in Holby as an agency nurse. It was announced on 7 June 2016 that following a "positive" response to her 2015 guest appearance, Shipton would be returning as a regular cast member in August 2016. Shipton expressed her "thrill" to return, commenting that "the future looks very exciting for Duffy both professionally and personally". She added that she was "excited" to be working with "such a talented and creative team of actors, writers, directors and producers." Executive producer Oliver Kent said that the show's team were "incredibly excited that the fabulous Cathy Shipton has agreed to bring Duffy back to the Emergency Department." He also expressed his excitement at having Duffy reunited with Charlie on-screen. Shipton said that being asked back to the show was "a no-brainer" and it is "very exciting" to be part of the show's team. Fans expressed their delightment about Duffy's return, with many praising the show for reintroducing the character. One fan commented that it was "so great to see Duffy back".
Shipton confirmed in June 2016 that Duffy would form a friendship with Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths), which she described as "very interesting". She revealed that their friendship wasn't written to be a friendship, but the producers were "so pleased with how it crackled as a paring", adding it was "good" to have relationships between "strong women". Shipton later mentioned in an interview with Elaine Reilly of "What's on TV" that she hoped the pairing between Elle and Duffy was "going to be developed." In addition, Shipton confimed that Duffy would reginite a friendship with Louise Tyler (Azuka Oforka), commenting that they would develop a "mother/daughter" relationship as Duffy "mentored" Louise. Shipton teased that Duffy could develop a personal respect for Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) to match the professional respect she currently holds for her. She also mooted a possible romance for Duffy and Charlie, adding that "maybe they’ll be the couple that finds each other." She added that both she and Thompson and Duffy and Charlie were "enjoying working together again" and said that "it could be game on" for Duffy and Charlie's relationship if we discover "the nuts and bolts of Duffy’s relationship with her partner".
Madiha Durrani.
Madiha "Mads" Durrani played by Hasina Haque, joined the cast of "Casualty" as a new nurse from Pakistan. She works in Resus and in CDU, has a very good friendship with Dr Yuki Reid.

She was persuaded by Zoe to join the gang at the pub even though she is Muslim. ‘Mads’ has recently had feelings for Lenny and asked him on a date although she did not turn up. Lenny was disappointed but still continued flirting with her in the ED. As they are just about to kiss they get interrupted and later Mads leaves for her brother's wedding in Pakistan and Lenny is too late to wave her off. It is later revealed that she becomes engaged during the wedding.
In the episode on 21 May 2011, it is possible that she is kidnapped by a taxi driver after Lenny rejects 'Mads' outside a bar. When she was kidnapped, it was revealed a taxi driver either raped or attempted to rape her but later came to the hospital with wounds around his face. 'Mads' caused the wounds herself while trying to fight him off and that day, swore she would be loyal to her religion and wear the hijab (scarf) on her head. On the day, she wore her hijab for the first time, she met a woman that had brought in a patient. They soon became friends.
In one episode, her new friend had brought her daughter in as she was feeling sick. She treated her and saw her friend's husband, the taxi driver that tried to rape her. Lenny thinks that Ash should tell the police because he thinks that he was attacked and so Ash does. But when the police officer asks him what the attacker looked like, he said that it was a man. Mads then later tells Lenny about the attacker and how she got into that taxi outside the pub when Ash attacked her. Shocked, Lenny tries to console Mads when 2–3 days later an explosion at Holby airport brings Mads and Ash face to face again. Ash was arrested for trying to flee the country on his brother's passport and assaulting Mads. Mads said that she was free and then takes her hijab (head scarf) off and says that just because she doesn't wear it doesn't mean she is not a Muslim and Lenny agrees. He then confesses his love for Mads, but she does not say anything. In series 26, she left to get married in Pakistan.

Di Martino had previously appeared in supporting roles in both "Casualty" and spin-off "Holby City". She auditioned three times for the part, and had to cease studying for her Masters degree in Applied Theatre when cast. She commented on her casting: "I feel very lucky to be joining such a long-running and well-established drama. I'm looking forward to Polly bursting onto screens, and hope viewers find her as much fun as I do." Series producer Oliver Kent added: "Sophia is a brilliant actress and we're very excited that she's joining us. We can't wait for the audience to see her - they're going to love her." Di Martino describes Polly as "very optimistic. She sees the best in everyone. She's fun, opinionated, brave and sometimes gets a little bit too close to her patients." After the suicide of homeless man Alistair MacCormack, who was infatuated with Polly, Polly was suspended while a full inquiry into his death was undertaken, after evidence given against her by Alistair's best friend, Abe, who believed that Polly should lose something that she really loved - her job - as revenge.

He quickly ends it, as he wishes to only be friends and because he still has feelings for Ruth.

Turner and Taylor left their roles in October 2011 and on 10 December 2011, following the revelation that Ruth was pregnant and being involved in the blaze that ripped through the ED, they left Holby to begin a new life. Executive producer Oliver Kent revealed that Turner had filmed scenes to appear in the feature-length special celebrating thirty years of "Casualty", "Too Old for This Shift", which airs on 27 August 2016.
Jay was described by the BBC as "a young Charlie Fairhead", that, despite being a "prankster" and a "restless soul", was a brilliant nurse. Potentially, one of the best to ever step through the doors of ED." Jay believes he is "God's gift to women" and has three rules of romance: "never lie, never make a promise you can't keep, and always stay for breakfast." However, Jay then falls for doctor Ruth Winters, and "everything change[s]".
Turner had previously guest-starred in "Casualty" as a male rape victim, and believes that this role aided his casting as Jay, explaining: "They sort of had me in mind and because the last story I did on "Casualty" was quite strong in terms of storyline, they really liked it and when I auditioned they were in full praise of that previous episode." He visited a real hospital as research for the role, to gain an understanding of what the job is like for real-life medical staff.
Jay began a relationship with Ruth Winters, after meeting her alone at a bar in "True Lies". Although rejected, the doctor later asks him to be her "plus one" to the surgeons dinners. He accepted and they attended together, which resulted in them getting closer, and eventually starting a relationship. In series 24, they continued in their relationship, though kept it secret until episode five "Not Forgotten" in which Jay grew annoyed and gave her an ultimatum. She decided to go public with a kiss in front of her colleagues. Their relationship then ended when Ruth took an abortion pill behind his back. They got back together in the Christmas episode "Tidings Of Comfort and Joy" but quickly ended once more when Ruth came clean to Jay and told him that it was really an abortion and not a miscarriage. Episode 42 "Die and Let Live" saw Jay through one his worst days, as he is told that the drugs trial he was part of for money could have landed him with the "crypto virus".

Howman left the show in 2016 and Rita departed on 16 July 2016, after less than three years on the show.
The BBC have described Rita as an excellent nurse who doesn't put up with any nonsense – junior doctors have been known to shake in her wake and patients do exactly what they're told. Not only is Rita straight-talking and direct, but she is an empathetic, kind nurse who will go to any lengths to help a patient. From her first appearance onscreen, Rita made a huge impact and she has since become a valued and important part of the Casualty team.
Rita was late for her first shift as Holby's new nurse due to contending with an injured neighbour whose hoarding has got out of control. She makes a strong first impressions on paramedics, Dixie Dixon and Jeff Collier as well as senior nurse, Fletch. Rita was given the task to teach Lily Chao a better bedside manner. Rita also becomes a shoulder for Dixie to cry on following her girlfriend's death and confides in her. While on a night out, Dixie and Rita kiss but are interrupted when they find a girl who has just been raped. She later uncovers the identity of the girl's rapist and has him arrested. Robyn told Rita about a man, who she found ironing his shirt in her house, and her worries about him. Rita said that she would be happy to ring the police for her and advised that Robyn should let her do so. The man was later revealed as Ben Chiltern and he began working at the ED as a nurse, where he was given the nickname, Lofty. Rita and clinical lead, Zoe Hanna treat prisoner, Frankie, who has taken several iron tablets and caused himself a kidney failure. He has only done this to receive attention from his mum who hasn't seen him since his imprisonment. Frankie flirted with Rita and when she says no to his advances, she reveals it is because her husband is dead. In July 2014, it was revealed that Rita's husband was in fact alive and was refusing to divorce her. Following Fletch's departure, the senior nurse position became vacant, leading to Rita applying for it and being successful. It was shown recently that Rita has been battling an alcohol addiction.
In the beginning of 2015, after her daughter Grace leaves for New York, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) blames Rita, as Grace went missing at the same time Rita's convicted sex offender husband returned to the hospital. Connie promises Rita that she will make Rita leave within six months. In May 2015, however, a patient of Connie's, Alfred Maxwell, an MND sufferer dies, and Rita accuses Connie of his euthanasia, hiding vital evidence that suggests otherwise from the police. Charlie however finds out, and the case is dropped. Rita began a relationship with Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) after numerous cases of flirting and a one-night stand.
Rita's former husband, who she left because he had a paedophilic relationship, shows up injured to the ED once again with the girl he exploited in tow. He has continued to pursue a relationship with her, and now she is of legal age. Rita tries to stay strong; she realises the girl is deluded in her devotion to him and tries to reason with her and tell her that she has been exploited, but after this puts the girl at risk once she tries to cut herself off from the case. However, the girl locks herself away in Connie's office and requests specifically that Rita coax her out; subsequently, Rita is intimidated by her former husband.
Rita tells Ian she loves him, and begins to take the relationship more seriously. Ian does not feel the same way and breaks up with her. They have a one-night stand soon after, but he tells her this was a big mistake and they break up once more. Rita, who was already vulnerable, is left heartbroken. She is so desperate to have him back that when asked about an injury to her eye, she explains it was her ex-husband, when in truth she hit it against a car's wing mirror while spying on Ian. Rita treats a patient who lies about her own injuries to her friend to gain her sympathy; the lies spiral out of control and she ends up making her injury potentially disabling. After this, Rita goes to come clean, only to catch Ian as he is off to teach her ex- a lesson. She tells him the truth; he brands her insane and tells her she should just leave the ED immediately. She gets the cold shoulder from everyone when she next returns to work, particularly from Louise, who cannot understand why she would lie about being abused. Although she manages to reconcile with both Ian and Louise, Rita realises she is out of control and has been making the same mistakes over and over. She takes her holiday leave and decides to go travelling, and cannot promise Charlie that she will return.
In 2014, series producer Erika Hossington spoke to "Digital Spy" about plans for Rita, saying that Rita will face a "tough" time and "We've also now found out more about Rita now that her secret has been revealed, and that will certainly play out for quite a few months. Rita is going to face a really tough time and she'll be pushed to her emotional limit. You'll have to watch and see whether she comes out of the other side." Hossington praised Howman's acting and commented that she has "risen" to the challenge of Rita's new storyline.

Jessica Harrison, played by actress Gillian Kearney, arrives in "Casualty" as an agency nurse but later becomes a Staff Nurse.
She had a one-night stand with Adam the night before her first shift and is shocked to realise that she will be working with him. They discuss having a relationship and she isn't keen but they eventually begin an affair, despite Jessica being married to Orthopaedic Consultant Sean Anderson and they have two children, Amelia and Lucas. Jessica ends the affair, feeling guilty that Lucas was injured while she was with Adam. She is shocked to discover Sean is having an affair too - with Zoe Hanna, and that she's expecting her third child. Unsure who is the father, she assumes it is Sean's, only telling Adam when she is admitted to the ED, following an accident at home. Unfortunately Sean guessed he might not be the baby's father on seeing Adam's reaction to Jessica's news. Devastated, he took Amelia and Lucas to Saudi Arabia for his new job as planned and told Jessica that she could only join them after she'd had an abortion but Jessica refuses, moving into a flat on the Farmead Estate after being evicted from the marital home.
Shortly after Harry's birth, he is rushed to the ED with breathing difficulties. Worried he might not live, Jessica tells Adam that he could be Harry's father and they reunite, naming their son Harry Adam Trueman. Desperate to see her other children, Jessica lies to Sean and his mother, Maureen, that Harry is Sean's son and receives her passport and a ticket to Saudi Arabia, as she knew he would. Despite Adam's anger, she takes Harry to Saudi Arabia but promises that they will return. Two weeks later, she returns with all three children.
Adam is initially furious but on calming down, asks her to divorce Sean, marry him and have a DNA test that confirms Adam is Harry's father. Jessica is furious with Adam when he calls Sean regarding Amelia and Lucas but agrees he can have access. She and Adam forgave each other and they decide to move in together and get engaged, planning to marry at the New Year. However, Jessica and Adam were not pleased to see Sean return to work at Holby City Hospital but accepted it. Sean tries making peace, realising he has behaved badly. Adam agrees to a fresh start but Jessica isn't as forgiving. Sean, however, has not given up hope of winning her back but is shocked by how much watching her with Adam and the children hurts.
On their wedding day, Adam is called back to the ED, following a minibus crash. They married in the hospital chapel and were returning to the venue to sign the papers but crashed en route. Adam's car sank into a lake with him, Jessica and Harry inside. All 3 were pulled from the water alive but Harry died. After 2 weeks in a coma, Jessica wakes up. However, she and Adam drift apart, and, feeling that she cannot stay with him and the memory of Harry, she and the children go to America with an old friend. Jessica returns to Holby at the end of "New Beginnings" after Alice calls her, worried about Adam's mental health. Initially Adam is hostile to her but after being sealed in the ED, worried about a possible anthrax scare, they reconcile. Back at Adam's house, Jessica seems happy to stay until she finds Harry's feeding spoon in a kitchen drawer. Unable to take any more, Adam insists Jessica make a decision about staying or leaving there and then.
In 2016, Kearney described filming the scenes in which Adam and Jessica's car submerged into a frozen lake as "the biggest thing" she has been involved in. She recalled that she had a "fear of water beforehand", before stating how "exciting" filming the scenes was because "it's so big budget and it's weird to see".
David Hide.
David Hide, played by Jason Durr, made his first screen appearance on 30 April 2016 as a staff nurse. 
The character and Durr's casting was announced on 24 February 2016, alongside those of Jez Andrews (Lloyd Everitt) and Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths). Executive producer Oliver Kent described the three castings as "wonderful" and said their storylines would be "brilliantly vibrant, bold and gripping". David is characterised as a "shy, withdrawn, and socially awkward" nurse. He was billed as someone who "goes about their work efficiently and quietly", with another side to his personality that would "love to be able to unleashed", but comes "at a price". Durr said he felt "delighted and thrilled" to be joining the "iconic" show in its thirtieth year, and described David as "intriguing". Durr confessed that despite being in a medical drama, he had "a huge phobia of needles and blood" and was hoping his new role would overcome his "life long fear". Durr's wife revealed through Twitter that he had begun filming on 14 January 2016. In the build up to the announcement of his casting, Durr had been tweeting various pictures linking to hospitals including a nurse uniform and an ambulance.
David was characterised as a "shy, thoughtful and withdrawn man who struggles with the social complexities of the world" by the BBC website. They described him as "a good and diligent nurse, who follows instructions well and goes about his job efficiently and quietly." They concluded that David would "love to be different" and "unleash the bold, confident side of his personality", but he is "too afraid of the consequences". Sarah Ellis of "Inside Soap" described David as "an oddball" with "a troubled past".
David's family was introduced in September 2016, with Harry Collett and Lorraine Pilkington cast as David's son, Ollie, and former wife, Rosa, respectively. In an interview with Ellis, Hide described David's relationship with Ollie as "wonderful", adding that he "loves him more than anything else in the world". He explained that there has been distractions in David's life which have prevented him from seeing "as much as Ollie as he wants to." David's absence from Ollie's life have created issues, which Hide said needed to "be dealt with". Rosa disapproved of David and Ollie's relationship due to her dislike of David's past behaviour, which she revealed in the middle of the ED. Hide believed that David did not "feel great" about Rosa's outburst, but said that David "strives to deal with it" and "tries to be positive". Hide, Collett and Pilkington filmed a stunt which saw Ollie left trapped in a car engulfed in flames and Hide described the scenes as "a joy to do" because it forces David "to step up, which is difficult for him".
During his first shift, David managed to impress consultants Connie Beauchamp and Dylan Keogh (Amanda Mealing and William Beck), despite having previously concerned Dylan by his lack of speech. David dislikes people calling him 'Dave' and is frustrated when consultant Elle Gardner repeatedly does this, but charge nurse Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) reassures him that she is only messing with him. David worked with Robyn Miller (Amanda Henderson) on various patients and begins to warm to her and so, he is devastated when he overhears Robyn saying how hard he is to work with. They worked together and brought a couple together, leading them to create a mortality café. David baked a cake for the café and he and Robyn launched it in their local pub. Robyn met Glen Thomas (Owain Arthur) and David discovers that Glen had been lying about having a wife and confronted him where Glen was forced to admith the truth to Robyn. David comforted Robyn and was shocked when Glen was admitted to the ED with a stage 4 brain tumour that he didn't want to tell Robyn about. However, David informed Robyn and they reunited.

Upon Venn's casting in the show, executive producer Oliver Kent described Jacob as: "...As Jacob, his good looks, charm and wit will certainly cause a tidal wave of testosterone in the emergency department. He's going to ruffle a lot of feathers and, no doubt, set a few hearts racing...".
Jacob arrives when he brings his friend into the ED following her collapse into his garage roof. He immediately rubs members of staff up the wrong way, but manages to impress clinical lead Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing). She suggests that he speak to clinical nurse manager Rita Freeman (Chloe Howman) about applying for a senior staff nurse position.

Robyn Miller.
Robyn Miller played by Amanda Henderson, is a staff nurse, who first appeared on 5 January 2013. She was introduced as one of four new student nurses; the others being Jamie Collier, Aiofe O'Reilly & Ally Hunter. Of the four, Robyn is the only character still present.
Robyn grew up knowing that she wanted to be a nurse. She's the oldest of four siblings and also volunteered to care for her beloved Nan as a teenager. People have always told Robyn that she's a 'born nurse'. As far as the "care" part of the job goes she's one of the best but she does worry about the academic side of the job – maths, chemistry and biology have never been her best subjects! Robyn is determinedly positive and extremely chatty. She makes friends easily and is able to charm patients and get them on side with her down to earth talkative charm. However, this can sometimes be her downfall as she loves a good gossip but isn't the best at keeping secrets!
When Robyn met her fellow student nurses, she instantly struck a bond with Jamie Collier and was devastated when he left. Robyn's stepbrother, Max Walker, was later introduced and he moved in with Robyn when his music career flopped. She managed to get him a job in the ED as a porter, replacing Big Mac.
Robyn was admitted in the ED as a patient when she went back home and found a man ironing a shirt he stole from Max's wardrobe. She began to chase him to the garden and over the fence where she jumped on to a rake, impaling her foot. The man, who told Robyn his name was Nigel, helped Robyn and called 999. He stayed with her as she was admitted in the ED but missed his interview at St James' Hospital. He had left his wallet behind when he left to try and save his potential job and Robyn saw that his name was actually Ben Chiltern. He returned, after feeling too guilty, and when questioned remained adamant that his name was Nigel. Robyn told Rita Freeman about him and her worries and she said that she would be happy to ring the police for her and advised that Robyn should let her do so. Robyn was about to until Ben came clean and told him about everything, including his name and the interview. She accepts his apology and offers him a room at her house, to which he gladly accepts. Robyn also manages to get him a job at the ED, replacing Jamie. This pleases him and Robyn gives him the nickname, Lofty, due to him living in the loft of her house. Robyn "mentors" him and shows him the ropes and they both work on the same cases often, until he settles in properly.
Robyn wins the respect of the new ED consultant, Connie Beauchamp when she arrives and Connie later gives Robyn a good report back for her trauma course.
Inspired by a recent case in the ED that she worked on with David Hide, the two decide to open a mortality café event in the local pub. There Robyn meets Glen, an apparently sweet, punny man who had recently lost his wife to cancer. After an awkward start, their relationship blossoms and Robyn is visibly elated. However, David notices something suspicious and discovers that there is no record of Glen's wife; it surmises he has fabricated the whole thing to win Robyn's pity. Robyn is incensed and declares her wish to never see him again.
Some time later, Glen is admitted to the ED with several physical injuries. When some test results show unusual signs, he admits that he has a cancerous tumour on his brain, which explains why he was so desperate to make a connection with Robyn. In light of this, Robyn forgives him. Though Glen has been told the cancer is terminal, Robyn vows to stick by him and encourages him to consider his options; she begins to take notes on his symptoms and develop diet plans. 
They visit Paris together and have other plans in mind, but right when Robyn is about to ask for his hand in marriage, Glen discovers he has less time than he originally thought, and has a seizure that sends him back into the ED. Though she is deeply troubled by the news, she remains optimistic and encouraging. Glen starts to think that marrying her would be cruel, considering he would leave her a widow after mere months, and that he is undeserving of her, but after a conversation with Dylan of all people, he decides to marry her, asking Dylan to tell Robyn while he is being treated. However, Glen develops complications during a CT scan and gets stuck in a lift en route to neurology. Robyn accepts his proposal over the intercom, and they prepare to get married that very same day. In the midst of all of this, Robyn is visibly tired and suddenly faints. Dylan administers a blood test on her, suspecting anemia, but it turns out she is pregnant. This leaves Robyn happier about her situation, since it means she will always have part of Glen with her. Unaware of this, Glen asks for paper on which to write his wedding vows just before the ceremony. He instead writes a letter to Robyn containing the message that he must leave her. Robyn is walked down the aisle only for David to hand her the letter, leaving her completely heartbroken.
Alicia Munroe.
Alicia Munroe, played by Chelsea Halfpenny, made her first screen appearance on 19 September 2015 as a doctor undergoing the second year of foundation training. After appearing in seven episodes, Alicia departed the series on 14 November 2015. Halfpenny's return to the show was revealed on 18 May 2016, with her return episode airing on 30 July 2016.
The show's trailer for Summer 2015 was released on 15 July 2015 and featured a clip of Halfpenny in doctor's scrubs. Halfpenny confirmed on "Twitter" that she had joined the cast and that her first episode would air on 19 September 2015. She auditioned for the role and said it was the most "nerve-wracking" thing she had done. For her audition, Halfpenny had to 'operate' on "a dummy patient", with her reaction being "squeamish". Alicia is billed as "bright and bubbly", while Halfpenny commented "she's got blonde and pink hair, so people expect her to be a bit ditzy, but she's not." Halfpenny also called Alicia "a bit of a try-hard" as she wants to impress everyone. Her popularity among her colleagues annoys Lily Chao (Crystal Yu), who struggles to connect with them personally. Halfpenny was highly publicised for playing Amy Wyatt in "Emmerdale" and she contrasted Alicia's characteristics with that of Amy, stating that whilst Amy "lied quite a lot", Alicia is "very happy-go-lucky" and someone who "sees the positive side to everything". She added that Alicia was "a young and kind person". Halfpenny previously appeared on the show in 2004 when she played a patient. Derek Thompson, who plays Charlie Fairhead, remembered Halfpenny from her previous appearance because of her "unusual" surname. Halfpenny stated that "one of the most challenging things" was pronouncing the medical terminology and that she was "always nervous" when she had a single line in a scene because "if I mess it up, everyone's going to be saying, 'Oh for God's sake!'" For the role, Halfpenny had to learn how to stitch, stating that the crew prefer the cast to stitch alone "as much as possible". Halfpenny revealed that her character would not have a love interest, but suggested a love triangle between Alicia, Caleb Knight (Richard Winsor) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). She added how she found it "really easy" to "make friends" with members of the cast.
Halfpenny described Alicia's first shift as "hell on earth" and revealed that Alicia would leave her colleagues, apart from Lily, "impressed" when she spots a "vulnerable" patient. Halfpenny also hoped that Alicia would make a "good" impression on viewers, but worried that she may "irritate some people with her bouncing around". She also added that Lily may "come across quite harsh", but hoped that they could have "a really nice friendship". Halfpenny was contracted to appear in seven episodes for a storyline which would see Alicia's mentor Lily Chao bully her, causing her to quit her job. Yu disliked filming scenes where she was mean to Halfpenny as they were friends off-screen. Halfpenny teased the episode airing on 14 November 2015, which would see Alicia leave the department. The episode is centric to Alicia and Halfpenny voiceovered the episode. She descriped it as "high drama" where viewers discover more about Alicia. Halfpenny described it as "the most challenging couple of weeks" of her career because she "had so much to do". Reflecting on the role, Halfpenny said that the episodes were "really nice" for her and that she "really enjoyed it" and had "a great time", describing it as "action-packed". Her role in "Casualty" had reminded her why she had left "Emmerdale", because she had "wanted to do other things".
The show's Summer 2016 trailer featured a clip of Halfpenny, with "Radio Times" confirming that she had returned to the role of Alicia. Cast lists for the series 30 finale showed that Alicia would be returning on 30 July 2016. Halfpenny later confirmed that she was returning to the show as a regular cast member, with Sophie Dainty of "Digital Spy" praising the news as "good news for "Casualty" fans". Of her return, Halfpenny said "I'm so excited and humbled for my character to have been brought back into "Casualty" as a regular cast member". She added that she was "honoured" to make her return in the series finale and was looking forward to "exploring Alicia Munroe a little bit more!" Halfpenny also promised "really interesting storylines" for Alicia. Elaine McCahill of "The Sun" reported that Alicia's return would see her return as a locum doctor, to the delight of Ethan and Louise, and "avoid" Lily, who she eventually realises "isn't as scary as she thought". She explained that Alicia returns to Holby because her parents divorced, causing her to "move back down south" and she later considers staying at the hospital.
Alison Graham of "Radio Times" described Alicia as "a dip-dyed flopsy" and "a cheerful Geordie with an almost supernatural ability to discover the secrets of others, just by looking at them." Her colleague, David Brown, described Alicia as "very upbeat and enthusiastic".
Alicia is a fun, bubbly girl who cares about everyone. She is very popular amongst her colleagues and seems to have a very close relationship with staff nurse Louise Tyler (Azuka Oforka). Her mentor Dr Lily Chao, CT2 registrar, starts to be very mean to her throughout her time in the ED. She continues to bully Alicia until she hands in her resignation to clinical lead Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), stating Lily bulling her out of the job as her reason for leaving. The following shift, Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker) announces that Alicia will not be returning.

In series 26, Sam restrained a patient from assaulting Dylan and in an interview with "Inside Soap", producer Nikki Harris teased Sam's next storyline saying, "Last week Sam restrained a patient, and it's something that will bubble under for the rest of the series. Whether or not she used excessive force on him becomes the subject of an investigation, and she ends up having to go to a hearing. It puts a huge amount of pressure on the ED because Sam's colleagues feel they must support her, but also have to remain truthful to themselves. Sam moved me to tears when I watched this week episodes."
Sam was cleared of any wrongdoing after new evidence was brought before the GMC by Zoe Hanna. Sam later tries to get Dylan to sign divorce papers after he hoped for them to get back together after the GMC trial. After Tom Kent talks to Dylan, he agrees that everyone should have a chance to live their lives, and signs the papers.

Kelsey Phillips.
Kelsey Phillips, played by Janine Mellor, made her first appearance on 6 August 2005. Kelsey was a staff nurse. She is a happy go lucky girl with a penchant for gossip, matchmaking, and generally unintentionally causing trouble in the workplace. She is notoriously bad with her finances, and during series 21 was almost forced into prostitution after being threatened with eviction for falling behind on her rent. She quickly dropped the profession when her first client turned out to be Nathan Spencer. She then revealed to Selena Donovan that Nathan was her client. Then at Tess Bateman's party Stitch Lambert caused friction and Kelsey and Nathan bonded. Kelsey thanked Nathan for not exposing her as a prostitute. She also stood up to Stitch.
Kelsey and Alice Chantrey started internet dating and both got dates but it was revealed that Kelsey's date was Big Mac, of which she was unaware. Noel took her out clubbing before Big Mac arrived.

R.
Yuki Reid.
Yuki Reid, played by Will Sharpe, is an F2 Junior Doctor. He was one of eight new Foundation House Officer Year 2 doctors joining the department at the start of series 24. He had known May since the beginning of medical school and helped her out with work, secretly smitten with her. However, May leaves the series after she frames Yuki for breaking a patient's neck, causing her to become paralysed. This resulted in Yuki running away and ending up being admitted to hospital after sleeping rough. After the breakdown of Yuki and May's relationship, he became very close to fellow F2 Lenny. Yuki and the F2s spent the majority of the series competing for the JAFA award, but on the day of the award ceremony he finds out that Lenny has been guaranteed the award in return for keeping quiet about a botched medical trial. After the reveal, the JAFA is cancelled, but Mr Jordan brings both doctors back. In the same episode, 'What Tonight Means to Me - Part One', a series of flashbacks explained that Yuki's brother had cancer and died, explaining his real reason for becoming a doctor, rather than because of his relationship with May, as previously believed.
In terms of personality, whilst he is a young, intelligent and handsome man, Yuki suffers from social anxiety, low confidence, low self-esteem, the tendency to obsess over detail and shyness. Still, he has shown that he can rise to the occasion when needed and his ability to diagnose patients is outstanding.

S.
Nathan Spencer.
Nathan Spencer, portrayed by actor Ben Price, was installed as the new corporate director of Holby city hospital NHS trust in 2005, and from the outset his unswaying mindset and failure to empathise with the human condition made him unpopular with his staff. His professional background was in banking, so his only concern was with meeting hospital targets and balancing the books. As a result, he would frequently clash with A&E consultant Harry Harper, even threatening to remove Harry from his post because he consistently refused to make any sort of (financial) compromise with patient care.
Nathan began his time at "Casualty" by stalking Selena Donovan. He was at one point jabbed with a needle which could possibly have been used by an HIV-positive patient. Nathan ordered a search of all clinical waste to find the needle and became more uptight than usual, with receptionist Alice Chantrey bearing the brunt of his anger. However, after being persuaded to take an HIV-test, Nathan was relieved to be given the all-clear. After starting a relationship with Selena, Nathan proposed marriage to her.
Displaying character traits of being a jobsworth and a stickler for the rules, Nathan took great pleasure in installing a large plasma TV screen in the middle of the department to enforce the "four-hour rule", a government directive in which 98% of all A&E patients must be seen, treated, and admitted/discharged within four hours of arrival. However, in blatant disregard of his own rules, on one occasion Nathan had his own mother admitted ahead of all those currently queued in the system. Harry Harper continued to clash with Nathan, so in another attempt to get rid of him, Nathan fabricated a charge of sexual harassment against him and persuaded Alice to make a complaint. Harry was suspended, but Alice became suspicious and withdrew her allegation when it threatened to devastate Harry's election campaign. Nathan was forced to confess all to Selena, who ended their engagement.
When Harry was unexpectedly elected as Holby's new MP (he stood for Parliament in a bid to save the Emergency Department from closure), Nathan installed wildcard Australian Theo "Stitch" Lambert as the new consultant. When he discovered Stitch in his office taking cocaine, he was convinced to keep quiet by the threat of the ridicule which would ensue if it was revealed Nathan had made such a poor staffing choice.
Later on in the series, Selena discovered she was pregnant with his baby. She informed Nathan that she had had an abortion, however later revealed to Harry that she had not actually done so. Nathan remained unaware of this until the last episode in the series, when Selena was shot dead. The team performed a Cesarean section on Selena, delivering her and Nathan a baby daughter, Angel. Angel later died in Nathan's arms after being diagnosed with a severe E. Coli infection in the NICU and he switched off her ventilator.
Nathan left the show in episode six of series 22. He was sacked for incompetence by Harry Harper, now having quit Westminster to return as the Emergency Department's consultant manager. Despite their previous working relationship Harry found the job difficult, knowing what Nathan had recently been through.
T.
Adam Trueman.
Adam Trueman, portrayed by actor Tristan Gemmill, is a consultant in the emergency department.
In preparation for the role, Gemmill spent 8 hours shadowing a real consultant on an ED shift as research for the role. Describing his character, he assessed: "Adam is self-confident, witty and brash, an excellent doctor who cares deeply about his job. He presents a strong exterior to the world but perhaps has issues and vulnerabilities that suggest there is more to him than you might first expect."
Upon his arrival, Adam clashes with clinical lead Harry Harper (Simon MacCorkindale), however they come to appreciate one another more with time. On Harry's last day, he offers Adam his job but Adam refuses and Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker) is given it instead. At a party, Adam meets Jessica Harrison (Gillian Kearney) and they have a one-night stand. He was shocked to find that she is the department's new nurse when he arrives at work the next morning. He and Jessica begin an affair, but she breaks up with him when her son Lucas is injured in a road accident while they are together.
At the beginning of series 23, following Jessica's discovery that her husband was also having an affair, Gemmill explained: "Adam is hopeful they will get together again but Jessica has a more realistic approach because obviously she doesn't want to abandon her children. She's having troubles with Sean, and she sort of more or less decides that actually 'no this is not going anywhere' and she has got to get over it, forgive Sean and move on with her life, which leaves Adam quite smacked in the face really. He has a bit of an unstable time of it." Gemmill added that: "Adam's state of mind is not helped by the arrival of Nick Jordan who comes into the department as Clinical Lead and has very definite ideas of how to run the place. Adam clashes with him almost straight away and they stay at loggerheads for some time."
Later in the series, Adam's brother, Alex, who was paralysed in an accident when they were children, begins to deteriorate from a resultant illness. Adam is devastated when his brother dies, and channels his anger towards Nick, who helped Alex sign an advance directive requesting not to be resuscitated. When Adam discovers Jessica's new son Harry could be his, the two renew their relationship. He is angry when she uses Harry as bait to get her other children, Lucas and Amelia, back from their father who has taken them to Saudi Arabia. They later reconcile, and Adam proposes. Although Jessica turns him down, they stay together, and a DNA test confirms Adam is Harry's father.
Jessica then later accepts Adam's proposal, and a wedding is being arranged for the New Year. Adam, Jessica and the three children are now all living together, with Adam taking an active role as father. Their New Year's Eve wedding is aborted when they are called back to the ED to deal with a major accident, and have to settle for a blessing in the hospital chapel. However, returning to the wedding venue to sign the legal papers, their car skids onto an icy lake and plunges in, ultimately leaving Jessica in a coma and Harry dead.
Jessica gradually recovers but she and Adam drift further apart, leading to her departure to America with an old school friend, Linda Andrews (Christine Tremarco) which leaves Adam devastated. He becomes increasingly reckless, having a one-night stand with young vulnerable HCA Alice Chantrey (Sam Grey) and inviting himself into a patient's house after work one night. Adam then begins a false relationship with the patient's mother, hoping to relive the paternal feelings he had for his own son, Harry, and Jessica's two other children. After this relationship disintegrates, Adam spirals further into depression.
Louise Tyler.
Louise Tyler (originally Tilney) played by Azuka Oforka, is a staff nurse. She first appeared on 1 October 2011, appearing for four episodes as an ambulance dispatcher before returning as the new receptionist, drafted in to give Noel Garcia (Tony Marshall) more support following the Holby riots on 18 August 2012. Louise is extremely organised, very efficient and loves to be in control. According to the BBC Louise has no problem giving a dressing down to anyone she considers lazy, a time-waster, in the wrong, or simply in her way.
In her first episode, Louise fell out with the paramedic duty manager, Dixie Dixon (Jane Hazlegrove) and when she returned as a receptionist, it was shown that they had still fallen out but episodes later, Louise had to get details of a patient who was in resus however, she was scared of going in because of the blood. Dixie noticed this and helped her overcome this fear. Louise and Dixie then became friends.

The character and casting was announced on 19 September 2013 alongside the announcement that Lee Mead would be joining that show as new nurse, Lofty. It was announced that Davis would be playing a "very chilled and laid back" porter. The BBC have described Max as a sponge for information, that just doesn't know how to harness it all yet. They also said how he is too busy dreaming of having an extraordinary life to engage with his real one. The character was also given a Twitter account, like Robyn, Jamie Collier and Louise Tyler.
Max first arrives when himself and his friend are admitted into the ED. He is told by Robyn that he won't be able to play his guitar for at least 6 weeks. He asks her whether he can stay at her house to which she agrees. Robyn continues to tell Max that he needs to find a job and when he remains jobless after three weeks of staying with her, she finds him a job at the ED as a porter, replacing Big Mac.
Max also takes a shine to clinical lead, Zoe Walker and they later sleep together. He also becomes friends with Jamie and when Jamie leaves for Australia, he becomes friends with his new housemate, Lofty.
Max has also pretended to be locum doctor, Cal Knight to win a girl round. When he arrived at work, he discovered that his one-night stand works at the hospital. She told him that she was the new consultant when really she had begun working at shop located there. She arrived at reception, asking for Cal but, fortunately, Max had filled Noel Garica in on what had happened and he covered for Max. When she discovered he was actually a porter called Max, she slapped him and told him she worked at the food shop and wasn't the new consultant before going off on a date with Noel.
Max is married to consultant Zoe Hanna after they moved in together in June. However, when Zoe revealed that she had slept with someone the night before their wedding, it left their relationship in tatters. After the accident at their wedding Zoe starts to try to talk to Max but each conversation is very brief and short, later on the series Max asks Zoe for a divorce as he still hasn't forgiven her. Max agrees to be friends with Zoe and tries to move on, but they later reconcile, shortly before she leaves Holby.
Ruth Winters.
Ruth Winters (portrayed by actress Georgia Taylor from 2007) is one of three new characters to join "Casualty" at the beginning of its twenty-second series. It was first announced on 18 July 2007 that Taylor had been cast in the role of Ruth. The BBC describe the character as "clever, hardworking and focused", stating that she has wanted to be a doctor since she was eight, and graduated top of her class - working hard at the expense of her personal life. Taylor herself has commented: "Ruth's very responsible and articulate, and seems pretty confident. But underneath it all, she's something of a troubled soul which hopefully we'll find out later on. She's very self-critical and won't allow herself to make any mistakes. But, for a junior doctor, the whole first year in a hospital is about making mistakes and learning from it. Ruth won't accept help from anyone; she thinks she knows it all."
During her first few months, Ruth misdiagnoses a patient with severe stomach pains, missing a ruptured ectopic pregnancy but blames a nurse so she can preserve her reputation. Ruth is shocked when her alcoholic father is admitted as a patient and reluctantly fakes a blood alcohol test so he will not be prosecuted for causing an accident but is devastated to realise he has manipulated her into this. Ruth goes on to give a patient the wrong medication and orders a nurse to remove another patient's neck brace, leaving them paralysed as a result. She lies about her culpability and accidentally gives a patient a morphine overdose. When a suicidal patient dies in her care, Ruth confesses her mother committed suicide when she was a child. When Ruth misdiagnoses yet another patient, resulting in his death, she hangs herself. She is in a coma for a month, but eventually recovers.
She becomes close to colleague Toby de Silva, and they have what Taylor describes as a "brother/sister relationship where they love each other but they can't stand each other." Ruth sleeps with new department head, Nick Jordan, only to be rejected by him the next morning. She goes on to begin a tentative relationship with nurse, Jay Faldren. Series producer Oliver Kent commented on their pairing: "Ruth's never allowed romance into her life, but when she starts to get close to Jay, the possibility of happiness with another person suddenly presents itself to her. But the question is, will she allow herself? Or will his laddish ways get in the way? She's so obsessed with her career that she's always tempted to put that first." In series 24, the first episodes show that Ruth and Jay are continuing their relationship - keeping it from their colleagues for her benefit but this annoys Jay, giving her the ammunition to kiss him in public but, when they head home, Ruth realises she has missed some pills and worries she could be pregnant. Discovering that she is pregnant, she takes a pill to terminate the pregnancy without telling Jay. On her birthday, Jay gives her a necklace for their date at the surgeon's dinner. Ruth's happiness is short-lived when senior medic Sarah Evans warns her that Jay is bad news and that she'll think twice about recommending her for the surgical training post if she continues to see him. Feeling unwell, Ruth cancels their date, but is confronted by Jay at the dinner. As Ruth leaves, she collapses and is taken into casualty. Mortified to be treated by her colleagues, she swears Tess to secrecy over the abortion pill, despite knowing that Jay is panic-stricken. When her condition stabilises, Ruth admits that she was pregnant and she and Jay share a tender moment. When Sarah Evans tells Ruth that she must remain focused if she wants to work as a surgeon, Ruth dumps Jay for the sake of her career.
Later in the series, her brother Jonathan, visits and reveals that he has just been released from prison. Ruth is horrified to see Jonathan when he turns up, looking for her help, much to Jay's surprise, who didn't realise she had a brother. Jonathan swears that he has turned over a new leaf but she sees his track marks, refuses to believe he's changed. Later, a group of hard-drinking homeless men cause havoc when they steal bottles of alcohol-based hand sanitiser and take it to an hospital annexe to enjoy in private. Tragedy strikes when young security guard, Mick, desperate for Ruth's approval, confronts the homeless men but Jonathan is quick to get help. Ruth looks forward to celebrating Christmas with her brother when she notices an heirloom is missing from her flat and plunged into a world of stolen phones, heroin overdoses and male prostitution, Ruth realises that she's likely to face Christmas alone. Days after a lonely Christmas, Ruth and Jay are thrown together on a medical case and Ruth finally admits that she's lonely. Letting down her guard, she accepts Jay's comfort and the pair go home together. However, this is short lived, when Ruth admits that she terminated the pregnancy, leading to Jay dumping her. This leads to her to build the courage to admit she loves him but he walks away anyway.
Months later, Ruth has a big presentation that goes horribly wrong. When conference organiser and big name doctor Edward takes an interest in her, she's incredibly flattered and a little bit smitten. Ruth married Edward Thurlow, Clinical Director of Neurosurgery on 26 June 2010, making Jay too late when he pleads his undying love at the register office, leaving Ruth to reveal that she has already married. Despite marrying Edward, it is hinted that Ruth still has feelings for Jay and that he feels the same. However, Ruth's feelings are spurned when she discovers Jay is dating Polly. She makes an effort with her marriage only to be neglected and ignored by Edward. While waiting for Edward to return home from work, she discovers that Edward is having a gay affair. She confronts him and makes a deal with him. For the sake of their reputations, they will stay married given that he can be with any man (except his lover) and as long as he helps her career. This agreement seems to suit them both until Ruth realises that she still loves Jay. She tries to end the marriage but Edward says that he loves her and that she is enough for him which makes her reluctant to change the situation.
However, in series 25 episode 17, Edward's boyfriend begins working with Ruth in the Emergency Department. This is followed by Ruth's realisation that he is still seeing her husband. Later, Edward leaves Ruth for his boyfriend. Later in series 25 episode 21, Ruth is sectioned after trying to operate on someone in the on-call room. She is diagnosed with Bi-polar. In series 26, Ruth and Jay reunite and in episode 13 Ruth discovered she was pregnant. In series 26 episode 16, Ruth and Jay leave together.

She discovers a woman that has tripped and cut open her arm and agrees to take her to the emergency department with her. She is greeted with a harsh welcome from doctor Lily Chao (Crystal Yu), who dismisses her. Later, after changing into her work attire, Honey announced herself as the new "barrister", but it did not take long for the staff to realise her mistake. Big Mac (Charles Dale) and Noel gave her a warm welcome as she began her new role.

Honey later begins to share a bond with doctor Ethan when she gives him advice to keep for when he is feeling low. When Ethan joined his friends at the local strip club, he was shocked to discover Honey was one of the dancers. He quickly ushered his friends away, before they could discover her secret. Honey later reassured Mac when he thought he could have a brain tumour. Honey later shocked Noel when she revealed he was her father after a one-night stand many years ago.

Honey is left annoyed when she is told she has to re-audtiton for her job as a pole dancer. As she was auditioning, Honey twisted her ankle and wanting to keep her secret discreet, called Ethan to help. At the hospital, Honey revealed she fancied Ethan who felt the same way, but before they could kiss, Noel walked in. Honey made sure her secret job stayed secret from Noel as their relationship progressed. Following their kiss, Ethan gives Honey the cold shoulder, leaving her upset. She tries to gain advice from Lily, but this works to no avail. Elsewhere, Big Mac has arranged a dinner party for himself, Noel, Louise and Honey, but Honey discovers that he is struggling financially. On Valentine's Day, Ethan writes Honey a Valentine's card. However, he is left devastated when she reveals that she is leaving for Manchester to care for her grandmother. Noel is also left in a mood by this, but Ethan makes him see sense. But, before Honey leaves, she kisses Ethan.

Honey then said goodbye to her friends and left Holby to set up her business.
Development and reception.
On 19 May 2014, it was announced that former "Waterloo Road" actress Chelsee Healey had begun filming in the show as new barista Honey Wright. Honey has "big hair and a big personality", and regularly gives tarot readings and aura interpretations to staff and patients. However, it has also been revealed that Honey is hiding a big secret. Executive producer Oliver Kent said: "I'm delighted that Chelsee has agreed to bring her unique combination of bounce and style to the Emergency Department. Honey Wright is like no other character we've ever featured in "Casualty" and I can't wait for the audience to see her and her tea trolley in action." Healey also revealed that she had signed a four-month contract with the show and that she would "love" to a long term contract. Series producer, Erika Hossington also revealed that Honey would be involved with established characters Noel Garcia, Ethan Hardy and Caleb Knight (Tony Marshall, George Rainsford and Richard Winsor). Healey later revealed that Honey would be romantically involved with Ethan, commenting that they "form a nice bond" and that it is "something to watch out for." Healey spoke of her role in October 2014, revealing that she was originally to play a nurse, but could not understand the medical terminology so was offered the character of Honey instead.
In November 2014, scenes aired which saw Honey's secret pole-dancing job revealed to Ethan. Speaking of filming these scenes, Healey said that she was initially "mortified", but eventually felt they were "fun". Healey also commented that she had received positive feedback since her on-screen arrival. Healey continued to speak about Honey's relationship with Ethan, stating the pairing is unlikely, but they work well together - making a "natural" relationship. She spoke of how Ethan likes "her vulnerable side" and that there is "something about Ethan that Honey's drawn to". Crystal Yu, who plays doctor Lily Chao, revealed that her character could become a hindrance in Honey and Ethan's relationship, teasing: "It’s interesting to see Lily’s reaction to Ethan and Honey’s romance. Time will tell if she’s jealous, supportive or even knows how she feels!" Rainsford, who plays Ethan, gave his thoughts to "What's On TV" about what Honey sees in Ethan, stating that it could be down to her poor love life: "I think Honey’s been mucked about by men before, but hopefully she sees in Ethan a gentleman who will treat her properly." Rainsford mentioned what he believed was the basis of their relationship, "The basis of their attraction is that they’re very different, but he’s got a good soul and I think that appeals to her." He also revealed that he has received positive feedback, with some fans wanting Ethan to begin a relationship with Honey, whilst others want Ethan to be with Lily.
Healey described her character as "out there" and compared Honey to her "Waterloo Road" character, Janeece Bryant, in the respect that she is "bubbly" and "speaks before she thinks." Erika Hossington, the show's series producer, described Honey as "fabulous" and "a breath of fresh air" and compared Honey to "The Call Centre's" Hayley. Honey has been described as "effervescent", "adorable", "dim-witted", and "ditzy". Rainsford described Honey as "outgoing, bubbly, gorgeous and open about her feelings".

Grace Beauchamp.
Grace Beauchamp was originally played in Holby City by twins Isabella and Scarlett Harrington Clark. Actress Emily Carey took over the role in November 2014, when the character was introduced to "Casualty". Grace is the daughter of Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) and Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers) and the younger half-sister of Kieron Patel.
Grace is born seven weeks premature and in the breech position. As she was starved of oxygen, she has to spend some time in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. After a scan shows that she has a bleed on the brain and internal bleeding, Grace is placed on a ventilator. Grace almost dies from an Intraventricular hemorrhage and has to have a blood transfusion. Connie decides to turn off Grace's life support when her ECG results show minimal brain-stem activity. When Doctor Ooma Chowdry (Sakuntala Ramanee) asks Connie if she wants to hold Grace, Connie declines, but Sam holds her and notices she is breathing on her own. Grace pulls through and Connie allows Sam increased access to his daughter. Sam ask Maddy to look after Grace and while Grace is in a room on her own, Susie Prendergast kidnaps Grace, thinking she is her baby sister. She threatens to drop Grace on her head, but Sam and Maddy persuade Susie to give her back. When Grace is 10 months old, she falls down the stairs and is badly injured. She is rushed to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and undergoes surgery for a collapsed lung and nearly dies. Grace leaves with Connie, who has decided to care for her father, who has been diagnosed with cancer.
A few years later, Grace is expelled from boarding school and returns to Holby. Her relationship with her mother suffers as Connie spends a lot of time at work. Grace's grandmother, Audrey Strachan, tells her that she is going to live in New York with Sam. Connie is against the idea, but later allows Grace to live with her father. She returns to Connie in February 2016 after nearly a year in America.
Connie places much more priority on her daughter following her return. However, Grace soon discovers her mother is in a relationship with Jacob Masters. Impatient from past experiences, Grace delivers an ultimatum and threatens to go back to America, so Connie stops seeing Jacob. Meanwhile, Grace returns to school in England and makes friends with a girl called Carmel. Connie helps Grace win over Carmel and her highly competitive mother by purposely losing at her school's sports day. As Grace's new friendship continues, her hold on her mother loosens and Connie begins seeing Jacob again in private. During a sleepover, Carmel injures her leg on a trampoline and Grace runs to her own house to get Connie. There she discovers Connie and Jacob alone together, which angers her.
At the hospital it is discovered that Carmel is malnourished and has scratches and bruising on her abdomen. Grace allows Carmel to blame her for the injuries. Jacob is convinced that Grace is lying, especially considering that she bites her nails and so can't scratch people. He coaxes the truth out of her; Carmel's mother has been psychologically abusing her daughter, and the injuries were self-inflicted. Connie confronts Carmel's mother and social services are contacted.
Following this shared experience, Grace decides to give her blessing to Connie and Jacob's relationship. The three are overjoyed, and Connie and Grace drive home together. Carmel's mother gives chase and forces them off a cliff. They are each thrown from the car but miraculously they survive. Due to the extent of her injuries and the location, Grace is airlifted to the ED. Catastrophically, a drone collides with the helicopter and it crashes into the entrance, worsening her condition. The second accident causes a subdural haematoma that sends her into a coma, and the outlook is not promising. The shock of this leaves Connie traumatised, and she spends almost all of her time at Grace's bedside. Finally, after several weeks, Connie witnesses Grace slowly awaken from her coma.

Londoner Samantha is nothing like Stella - I dyed my hair to leave Stella behind which fitted in well with the role.

Since leaving Corrie it's been great to get my teeth into different characters and I'm looking forward to new opportunities which have been coming my way."
