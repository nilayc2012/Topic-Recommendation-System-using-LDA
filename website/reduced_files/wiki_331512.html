 <p>This article refers to self portraits and portraits of Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890). It includes self-portraits, portraits of him by other artists, and photographs, one of which is dubious. Van Gogh's dozens of self-portraits were an important part of his oeuvre as a painter. Most probably, van Gogh's self-portraits are depicting the face as it appeared in the mirror he used to reproduce his face, i.e. his right side in the image is in reality the left side of his face.
Periods.
Paris 1886.
The first self-portrait by van Gogh that survived, is dated 1886.
Saint-Rémy.
All the self-portraits executed in Saint-Rémy show the artist's head from the left, i.e. the side with non-mutilated ear.
Auvers-sur-Oise.
No self-portraits were executed by van Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise, during the final weeks of his life.
Scandals.
In Nazi Germany, Vincent van Gogh paintings were among those labelled "degenerate art". Works were stolen and/or destroyed by German authorities including the self-portrait dedicated to Paul Gauguin, September 1888, depicted in the black and white picture.
Fakes.
Almost at the same time as when his "Catalogue raisonné" was published, Jacob Baart de la Faille had to admit that he had included paintings emerging from dubious sources, and of dubious quality. Shortly after, in 1930, De la Faille rejected some thirty odd paintings, which he had originally included in his catalogue - together with a hundred of others he had already excluded: "Self-portraits" - and "Sunflowers" - held a prominent place in the set he now rejected. In 1970, the editor's of De la Faille's posthumous manuscript brand marked most of these dubious "Self-portraits" as forgeries, but could not settle all disputes, at least on one:
Meanwhile, the authenticity of a second ""self-portrait"" has been challenged:
