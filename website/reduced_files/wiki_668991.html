Cross Hands Public Hall is one of only three of its kind in Wales. The Public Hall was erected in 1920 and designed by an unknown Italian Designer in the classic Art Deco Style. Fully restored, the Public Hall has a fully functioning stage and cinema screen and is protected as a Grade 2 listed building.
The continuous built up area which includes the villages of Cross Hands, Gorslas, Cefneithin and Pen-y-groes had a population of 5,717 in 2011.
Cross hands is a growing residential and employment area and includes the established Cross Hands Food Park to the south west of the A48. A new business park - the Cross Hands Business Park is being developed to the northest of the A48 which the local authority hopes will create 1,000 jobs.
Gweunydd Glan-y-glasnant, a Site of Special Scientific Interest notable for its species-rich neutral grassland, is south-west of Cross Hands.
Future developments.
Carmarthenshire county council intends to build a new link road which will allow traffic on the A476 to bypass the congested Cross Hands roundabout. The new Road will start from a point to the northeast of the crosshands roundabout and be routed via the Cross Hands Food Park junction on the A48 and reconnect with A476 at a point south west of the Cross Hands roundabout.
