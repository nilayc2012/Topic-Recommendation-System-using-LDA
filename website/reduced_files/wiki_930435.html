 <p>The DiMeo crime family, later referred to as the Soprano crime family, is a fictional Mafia family from the HBO series "The Sopranos." It is thought to be loosely based on the DeCavalcante crime family, a real New Jersey Mafia family.
The DiMeo crime family consists of an administration and six crews. The following is a list of fictional characters from "The Sopranos" that are associated with the DiMeo crime family.
Soprano crime family overview.
History.
Formation.
In the series, the DiMeo crime family is believed to have been formed in Northern New Jersey in the 1950s.
Ercole DiMeo is believed to have been the first official boss, although according to the book, "The Sopranos Family History" by Allen Rucker and David Chase, there was an earlier boss named Alfano, but that boss is never mentioned in the series. Key members from the 1960s include brothers John Francis "Johnny Boy" Soprano and Corrado "Junior" Soprano, as well as Raymond "Buffalo Ray" Curto, Michele "Feech" La Manna, Patrizio "Uncle Pat" Blundetto, Robert "Bobby" Baccalieri, Sr., and Giuseppe "Beppy" Scerbo. Herman "Hesh" Rabkin was a key associate, but as a Jew could never become a made man. The Sopranos were a key faction in the DiMeo crime family, running two separate crews led by Johnny Boy and Junior, and also had longstanding ties with the five New York Families (particularly the Lupertazzi crime family led by Carmine Lupertazzi). Despite DiMeo's reign as Boss, it is implied throughout the series and stated in the finale by Tony Soprano that the two Soprano brothers unofficially ran North Jersey.
Unrest of '83.
During the early and mid-1980s many DiMeo crime family members and associates were arrested, causing the biggest blow to the family since its formation. Among those arrested were Tony Blundetto and Michele 'Feech' La Manna, sentenced to 17 and 20 years, respectively. When released in 2004, they were referred to in the media as the "Class of 2004".
It was during the Unrest of '83 that Salvatore "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero, a cat burglar and associate in the Johnny Boy Soprano crew, stood up for (i.e., carried out a killing on behalf of) Johnny Boy Soprano. Johnny Boy's son, Tony Soprano, who became one of the fastest rising stars in the Family after holding up Feech La Manna's card game with Aprile crew chief Giacomo "Jackie" Aprile and their childhood friend Silvio Dante, would make his bones, as shown in the episode Remember When, by killing a small-time bookie and become a made man shortly thereafter.
Rise of Tony Soprano.
Johnny Boy Soprano died of emphysema in 1986. Before his death, he requested that his son become the capo of the Soprano crew. Tony was a relatively young man to be a capo at the age of 27. Tony's transition into captain was aided by the loyalty of Bonpensiero, longtime Johnny Boy Soprano soldier Peter Paul "Paulie Walnuts" Gualtieri, and childhood friend Silvio Dante. Tony would also avoid a long stint in prison when he missed a failed hijacking involving his cousin, Tony Blundetto. Caught by the police, Tony B. ended up getting charged under the RICO law and spending 15 years in prison, while Tony became one of the top earners in the DiMeo Family. At first, Tony said he was robbed by two black men, but he later admitted to Dr. Melfi and to Tony B. that he had a panic attack after arguing with his mother and passed out, missing the hijack.
Richie Aprile is arrested in 1990 and sentenced to ten years in prison. He gives control of his crew over to his younger brother, Jackie Aprile.
New acting boss.
Ercole DiMeo was convicted and given a life sentence in prison in 1995. Jackie Aprile was named Acting Boss of the family by DiMeo, much to the chagrin of Junior Soprano. It was assumed that Junior would take over when DiMeo died or went to prison since he was one of the oldest and senior mobsters in the DiMeo family. DiMeo was impressed with Jackie Aprile's leadership abilities, the Aprile crew had been the top earner and best-run crew of the family for years. The years of Jackie's tenure as Boss (1995–1999) are generally considered to have been peaceful, prosperous years; Jackie was a well-respected and much beloved Boss who didn't "eat alone," much to the contentment of his Capos.
War of '99.
When Jackie Aprile was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1998, Tony Soprano, his closest friend and Junior's nephew, basically took over Jackie's responsibilities, again to Junior's displeasure. Uncle Junior and Tony were, at that point, at each other's throats because Junior plotted to have a rival, Gennaro "Little Pussy" Malanga, killed in Malanga's favorite restaurant, Vesuvio, a restaurant owned by Tony's childhood friend Artie Bucco. Tony foiled Junior's plans by ordering Silvio Dante to set fire to Artie's restaurant to prevent the hit from happening. Also, Tony's nephew, Christopher Moltisanti and his associate Brendan Filone, were hijacking trucks from Comley Trucking, a business that paid protection to Junior. Junior's enforcer, Mikey Palmice, killed Brendan, and hired Russian hitmen to perform a mock execution on Christopher under Junior's orders. When Jackie Aprile died in the summer of 1999, and tensions between Junior and Tony were at an all-time high, it was assumed that the two would go to war over the top position. Tony instead deferred to Junior, giving him the official title as Boss. This was effectively in name only, as Tony still controlled the capos in the family and was the main conduit to the Lupertazzi Family, represented by underboss John "Johnny Sack" Sacrimoni.
Tensions flared up between Junior and Tony after Tony's mother, Livia Soprano, revealed that Tony was seeing a psychiatrist and had been meeting secretly with his capos in Livia's nursing home. An assassination attempt on Tony was made, but Tony luckily escaped with just an injury to the ear, leaving one hitman dead when the other accidentally shoots him while aiming at Tony. The FBI revealed to Tony that his mother's retirement home was bugged and let Tony listen to the tapes in a failed attempt to get him to flip. The tapes revealed that the assassination attempt was concocted by Junior and made it sound like his mother was in on it, too. In retaliation, Tony ordered the deaths of key members of Junior's crew: soldier Chucky Signore, consigliere Mikey "Grab Bag" Palmice, and acting capo (after Junior's arrest) Phillip "Philly Spoons" Parisi. Junior Soprano was spared when he was indicted by the federal government, along with underboss Joseph "Beppy" Sasso and capo Lawrence "Larry Boy" Barese, and because Tony wished to keep him as the lightning rod that took the hits for the Family. Tony then took over virtually all of Junior's business and became the Boss of the now renamed Soprano Crime Family. Former Junior Soprano soldiers Gigi Cestone and Pasquale "Patsy" Parisi defected over to various crews on Tony's side. Gigi Cestone went to the Aprile crew. Tony named Silvio Dante as his consigliere, and promoted long-time soldier Peter Paul "Paulie Walnuts" Gualtieri to captain of his old crew, renamed the Gualtieri crew. Patsy Parisi went to the Gualtieri crew.
Although Junior had been usurped of nearly all power and was under house arrest awaiting trial, he still retained the title of Boss, as Tony wanted the FBI to think they had indicted the head of the family, and acted as an adviser to Tony. Two of the factors that brought the two closer together was when Junior informed Tony of Richie Aprile's plot to kill Tony, and take over the family, and when Junior was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2001. However, Tony continued to punish Junior through business arrangements, and only allowed him to earn on a "subsistence level." Junior managed to beat the disease before the RICO trial against him started.
FBI investigations.
After years of investigating Tony Soprano (at one point trying to turn him into an informant) and failing to connect him to the murder of associate Matthew "Matt Drinkwater" Bevilaqua (which was tossed out when an eyewitness retracted his statement upon learning one of the shooters may have been Tony Soprano), the FBI arrested Tony in 2000 when it was discovered that he had been extorting Davey Scatino. While busting out Scatino's sporting goods store, Tony had been receiving stolen airline tickets, discovered by way of information given by turncoat Salvatore "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero and Tony's giving one of the stolen tickets to his mother, Livia. The case fell through when Big Pussy "disappeared" and Livia died of a stroke. The FBI continued to build a case against Tony, but fell on difficult times when a wiretapping of his basement was compromised (when Tony's daughter Meadow Soprano took the lamp they had bugged) and because of the deaths of several FBI informants.
In 2002, the RICO trial against Junior Soprano ended in a hung jury, but the government moved to schedule a re-trial, meaning Junior had to stay under house arrest. Due to his diminished position in the family because of the house arrest, longtime Junior Soprano loyalist Robert "Bobby Bacala" Baccalieri was named acting Capo of the Junior Soprano crew after it became clear that his elderly, senile Capo, Murf Lupo, wasn't up for it anymore.
Periods of unrest.
In the meantime, the Soprano Family continued to stay in a period of transition, with Richie Aprile, older brother of Jackie Aprile, taking over the previously defunct (due to the death of Jackie Sr.) Aprile crew after his release from prison in 2000. Richie became a threat to Tony's power, crippling associate Beansie Gaeta and disobeying Tony repeatedly when it came to selling cocaine on garbage routes. Richie also came to Junior about overthrowing Tony, but Junior decided that he would be better off with his nephew. Tony caught wind of Richie's plot and set the wheels in motion to have him killed, but he was spared the trouble when Richie was killed in the heat of an argument by his fiancée, who coincidentally happened to be Tony's sister Janice Soprano.
When Gigi Cestone, a Soprano crew soldier set to take over and spy on the Aprile crew, dies of a heart attack, Tony has no choice but to install rival Ralph Cifaretto as captain. Tony had longtime problems with Ralph, despite the two having grown up together (along with Jackie Aprile and Silvio Dante). At one point, Tony, in a fit of rage, hits Ralph after the latter murders a Bada Bing dancer named Tracee. Ralph also took under his wing Jackie Aprile, Jr., even though Tony and Jackie Sr. both wanted to keep Jackie Jr. out of the family business. When Jackie Jr. held up one of Ralph's underling's poker games and shoots at made men Furio Giunta and Christopher Moltisanti in an attempt to emulate his father, Ralph had no choice but to order Jackie's death (the contract carried out by Vito Spatafore).
Complicating matters is that Ralph is the family's best earner, running lucrative construction deals such as the Esplanade Construction site and HUD scams in Newark. When a racehorse owned by Ralph (and beloved by Tony) named Pie-O-My dies in a stable fire, Tony becomes convinced that Ralph cruelly and intentionally killed the horse to help pay medical expenses for his hospitalized son (wounded in an accident while playing with a friend) with the insurance money. In a fit of anger and outrage, Tony attacks and kills Ralph. Christopher then helps Tony dispose of the body, dismembering it and placing the several body parts in different dump sites. Tony blames Ralph's disappearance on the New York family—specifically Johnny Sack, who had had a beef with Ralph over a characteristically tasteless joke of Ralph's about Johnny's wife, Ginny, told at a Soprano mob family dinner. Vito Spatafore was named captain of the Aprile crew in 2002.
During that time, Tony Soprano began to groom his cousin/nephew, Christopher Moltisanti, for a leadership role. Christopher, already considered young to have been "made," was named acting Capo of the Gualtieri crew while Paulie Walnuts was in jail facing a gun charge (later dropped). Patsy Parisi was dissatisfied with this choice, as was Silvio Dante who wanted to see Patsy as Capo. In addition, Tony names Christopher his successor, a move that is severely compromised when Christopher is discovered to have a serious heroin addiction and is sent to rehab. Christopher temporarily cleans up and proves his loyalty to Tony by giving up his fiancée, Adriana La Cerva for execution when it is discovered that she has been cooperating with the FBI. As a reward for putting the Family above his fiancée, Chris is made captain of the Gualtieri crew (with Paulie Gualtieri promoted to Underboss.)
It is during this period that the working relationship between the Lupertazzi Crime Family and the Sopranos reaches a rocky point in 2002, when the two families join together to control the Esplanade construction site in Newark, New Jersey. Disagreements over the split of the money of the Esplanade, plus the HUD projects that Tony was keeping secret from Lupertazzi and the displeasure of Johnny Sack with Ralph Cifaretto, nearly cause the two families to go to war. Johnny Sack and boss Carmine Lupertazzi blame one another for the conflict, and each of them reach out to Tony to whack the other as a means of ending the conflict. In both cases, cooler heads prevail and the two families work out a deal...
Class of 2004.
The prison release of "The Class of 2004" (Phil Leotardo, Angelo Garepe, Michele "Feech" La Manna, and Tony Blundetto) along with the death of Carmine Lupertazzi set off another series of conflicts. "Little" Carmine Lupertazzi and Johnny Sack went to war over the position of Boss in New York, and Tony had to deal with the insubordination of Feech La Manna and his cousin, Tony Blundetto. One problem in his family was solved when Feech La Manna was sent back to prison after stolen flat-screen televisions were found in his garage by a probation officer called on the orders of Tony Soprano. The other problem was complicated when Tony B. killed Lupertazzi associate Joe Peeps on the orders of Lupertazzi Capo Rusty Millio and consigliere Angelo Garepe. When Angelo was killed in retaliation, Tony B. went after Phil Leotardo and killed his brother, Billy Leotardo, in an unsanctioned hit. Faced with threats of war and torture from Johnny Sack and Phil Leotardo plus unease in his own family, Tony Soprano was left with no choice but to kill Tony B. himself.
The relationship between New York and New Jersey families was further complicated when Johnny Sack was busted by the FBI and sent to prison to await trial, and Phil Leotardo, still nursing hard feelings about Blundetto, was named Acting Boss of the Lupertazzi Family.
Shooting of Tony Soprano.
During his house arrest and trials/re-trials, Junior developed signs of dementia. He suffered a head injury after being hit with a boom microphone and knocked down the courthouse steps. Several mini-strokes over the years increasingly diminished his capacity and led him to shoot Tony in the abdomen, mistakenly thinking that Tony was his already deceased nemesis "Little Pussy" Malanga.
The shooting of Tony Soprano set off a media frenzy, with reporters stalking the Soprano house and outside the hospital where Tony lay in a coma. Junior Soprano was arrested and questioned about the shooting, which he insisted must have been a self-inflicted gunshot by Tony, whom he labeled as a "depression case". The captains of the Family agreed to cut all ties to Junior and allow Tony to decide what happens to him. Junior was judged to be mentally unstable and was sent to a mental rehabilitation facility.
With Tony incapacitated, his consigliere Silvio Dante took over as Acting Boss of the Soprano Crime Family; however, Silvio was unable to handle the pressure of being boss, and suffered an asthma attack that put him in the hospital. Tony, after a near-death experience, would awake from his coma soon after, just in time to settle a dispute over the future of Barone Sanitation with Johnny Sack and Phil Leotardo.
Tension with New York.
While in prison, Johnny Sack reached out to Tony through Phil Leotardo to whack his insubordinate capo, Rusty Millio. Tony refused at first, but had a change of heart after talking to Johnny Sack at his daughter's wedding. Tony conducted the execution of Millio with caution, bringing in two men from Naples to carry out the hit on Rusty and his soldier, Eddie Pietro. Johnny Sack later plead guilty in his RICO trial to lessen his sentence, thus making Phil Leotardo the boss in all but title.
More complications occurred in the organization when Vito Spatafore, the top earning captain of the Aprile crew and cousin-in-law to Phil Leotardo, fled New Jersey after his homosexuality was revealed. Carlo Gervasi was named by Tony as the replacement point man for the Family's construction interests. After hiding in New Hampshire for months, Vito returned to New Jersey, approaching Tony about starting up a separate operation in Atlantic City involving prostitution. Tony considered the request, but ultimately decided that Vito needed to be taken out in order to placate Phil Leotardo, who was incensed about Vito's lifestyle. However, Phil got to Vito first, breaking into his hotel room and watched while soldiers Dominic "Fat Dom" Gamiello and Gerry Torciano beat his cousin-in-law to death. Tony, realizing that Phil was sending the message that New York can do whatever they want, decided to hurt Phil financially as payback for Vito. Tony reasoned that a war with New York would prevent his family from earning. However, when Fat Dom went to Satriale's on a delivery stop and made jokes about Vito's death and implied Carlo was a homosexual, Silvio and Carlo killed the New York soldier.
Tony's response to Vito's murder was to blow up a wire room held by Phil in Sheepshead Bay — Benny Fazio was on the scene for the explosion. After a sit-down between the New Jersey and New York Families, a truce was nearly reached before a reference from Little Carmine to the death of Billy Leotardo resulted in Phil Leotardo storming out. At a conference with Gerry Torciano, Albie Cianfiore, and Butch DeConcini, a decision was reached to take out a high-ranking member of the Soprano crime family. Butch was particularly vocal in his desire to kill Tony, but Phil had more sense than that, and decided against it. Phil suffered a massive coronary soon afterwards and FBI Agent Harris informed Tony that someone on his crew could be in danger. In an attempt to clear the air between them, Tony paid a visit to Phil's hospital bed, telling him of his own near-death experience. During his disagreement with Phil about an asbestos removal project, Tony reminds him of their discussion in the hospital but Phil snubs him. Tony retaliates by taking two members of Phil's crew off a project payroll, after which one of them threatens Tony's daughter Meadow. Tony retaliates by curb-stomping him on a wooden step in a restaurant in front of Butch DeConcini, shattering all of the threatener's teeth. Phil refuses to meet with Tony after this incident and war between the two families seems imminent.
The War of 2007.
It becomes clear that there is no compromise available between NY and NJ, and as a result the wheels begin to turn. New York convinces Burt Gervasi to switch sides, and he approaches Silvio Dante to join in on a coup d'état attempt on Soprano. The likely idea is that if Tony is killed, Silvio will take over and make peace, and Gervasi will be rewarded. Silvio responds by strangling Burt Gervasi at his house with a garotte. Soprano knew what had to be done, and arranged for Phil Leotardo to be executed. At the same time, Phil had a war-room discussion where he arranged for New Jersey to be wiped out. Phil gives orders to "decapitate the leadership" of the Sopranos and "do business with what's left", and orders contracts on Tony Soprano, Silvio Dante and Robert "Bobby Bacala" Baccalieri. The Sopranos attempt to hit Phil went awry however when Phil's Ukrainian mistress and her father were mistaken for Phil and were mistakenly killed by the non-English-speaking Italians who were brought over from "the other side" specifically to perform this contract.
The hits "on" the Sopranos in New Jersey took place with more finesse, however. Bacala is killed at a model train shop when two assassins ambush him. Word comes down that Leotardo has vanished, and the Soprano Family decides to do the same. However, as Patsy Parisi and Silvio Dante attempt to go on the lam, they are ambushed by a pair of New York hitmen outside the Bada Bing. In the ensuing carnage, Silvio Dante is shot multiple times but Parisi escapes. Silvio is rushed to a hospital where he is left in a coma. Tony and some soldiers head to a safe house to hide, as the search for Phil continued. Tony, surrounded by bodyguards, attempts to sleep while holding an AR-10 rifle in his arms, which Bobby gave to him on his 47th birthday,
Tony came out of hiding shortly after and arranged a sit down with Butch DeConcini and Albie Cianflone through "Little" Carmine Lupertazzi and retired Five Families Boss, George Paglieri. During this meeting the New York Family agreed that Phil Leotardo's decision to go to war with North Jersey was a bad one, has gone much too far and that consequently the New York leadership would back off. Tony also demanded that they give him a location on Phil, but Butch refused to tell of Phil's whereabouts (either because he didn’t know or still felt loyal to his boss). Butch did, however, give Tony implicit permission to take Phil out should he find him, without retaliation from Butch and New York. Butch also agrees to financially compensate Bobby's widow. Since Tony had previously given FBI Agent Harris information on two Pakistani men that used to be small-time associates of the family, Harris eventually told Tony that Phil had been making calls from a pay phone at a gas station in Oyster Bay. The Soprano family began patrolling the area's gas stations looking for Phil. It wasn't long before Walden Belfiore, a soldier in the Gervasi crew, caught up with Phil at the gas station. Phil was shot in the head and chest in front of his wife and grandchildren. His vehicle was in gear and, while Phil was on the ground, the driverless SUV ran over his head. The New York/New Jersey war was brought to its final conclusion.
1995-1999 — Giacomo "Handsome Jackie" Aprile Sr. — died of stomach cancer in 1999. Was de facto Boss but referred to himself as the Acting Boss out of respect to DiMeo.
Historical leadership.
Boss (official and acting).
1999-2005 — Corrado "Junior" Soprano — imprisoned house arrest 2000-2006, was unknowingly a front boss for his nephew Tony. By 2000 Tony fully controls the family. Interned in 2006.
2005-unknown — Anthony "Fat Tony" Soprano - 
Ercoli DiMeo, a.k.a. "Old Man" and "Eckley", is the founder and the longtime boss of the DiMeo crime family. By the events of season one, he is boss in name only and never demonstrates any influence over the family. He is serving a life sentence in a high security United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. When the death of Giacomo "Jackie" Aprile is reported in season one, the television news reporter states that Aprile "was the acting boss for the 74-year-old Ercoli "Eckley" DiMeo", which makes DiMeo more than 80 years old if he is still alive at the end of the series.
Administration.
Ercoli "Eckley" DiMeo.
DiMeo ran the family from sometime in the 1950s until he received a sentence of life imprisonment in 1995, at which point Giacomo "Jackie" Aprile became acting boss of the family. Jackie already had full control in 1999 (the first season of "The Sopranos"); at one point he said, "I may be acting boss while the old man's a guest of the government" out of deference to DiMeo.
DiMeo was apparently a major force in his prime. He served as a mentor to Tony Soprano and, according to other characters, had Tony and Jackie pegged early on as eventual candidates for boss. DiMeo also took a liking to Tony's father "Johnny Boy" Soprano, and it is likely that Johnny would have been acting boss had he not died of emphysema in 1986. However, it is clear that DiMeo had great muscle behind him when he led the family, as prominent capos "Johnny Boy" Soprano, Corrado "Junior" Soprano, and Michele "Feech" La Manna were below him.
Beppy Sasso is an original member of the DiMeo crime family. He was the underboss at the time that the show started. He was indicted on federal racketeering charges, along with recently named boss Junior Soprano and caporegime Lawrence Barese. Sasso has the shortest on-screen time of any character, answering the door of his house in a robe. He is described as an "ailing underboss" in the fictitious media reports surrounding the DiMeo crime family. It is unknown when Sasso became underboss. There is speculation that Junior Soprano promoted him when Junior became boss in 1999, but that is unlikely since he is described as "ailing underboss." He was likely underboss for either Jackie Aprile from 1995 onward, or for longtime boss Ercoli Dimeo prior to 1995.
Alfie is part of the group Little Paulie takes to vandalize Carmine's restaurant over the HUD dispute. He spray paints a drawing of a penis on a painting that Johnny Sack said once hung in the office of Fiorello LaGuardia.
Perry Annunziata, also known as "Muscles Marinara," is from Bloomfield, New Jersey. He serves as a bodyguard and driver for Tony Soprano during his recovery from a gunshot in 2006. Tony calls him Penne Arrabiata (as in the pasta dish penne all'arrabbiata), on account of his getting angry (Italian: arrabbiato) at a rude driver while driving Tony. He is first runner-up in Mr. Teenage Bloomfield and cousin of Gina Annunziata. Tony picks a fight with Perry at Satriale's to regain the respect of the family following his injury, selecting Perry specifically because of his muscular build and hot-headed nature. Perry knows the ramifications of beating up a mob boss, yet he still tries to fight back. Tony beats him to the ground and gives him a broken nose. Tony later pays Perry off as an apology for the altercation, although Perry states that he was in the wrong. Perry takes advice from both his father and from capo Carlo Gervasi. He renews his duties by accompanying Tony to the Feast of Saint Elzear and to Christopher Moltisanti's belated bachelor party. Annunziata is driving Tony when he discovers the corpse of Fat Dom Gamiello at Satriale's, but he remains in the car. There is a "soldier" from the DeCavalcante crime family, which The Sopranos is based on, named Daniel Annunziata.
Matthew Bevilacqua was Sean Gismonte's partner-in-crime and an associate working under Christopher Moltisanti in the Gualtieri crew. Matt and Sean worked with Christopher at various aspects of organized crime including: the Massarone Construction site, a Pump and Dump of stocks in the website Webistics, the Junior Soprano's executive card game, and some burglary jobs with Chris and Sean. Sean and Matt both tried to impress Tony, but angered him by speaking candidly about criminal activities when the conversation could have been recorded by law enforcement.
Tony Soprano/Gualtieri/Moltisanti crew associates.
Matthew Bevilaqua.
They wanted to move up rapidly in the ranks of the family. Hoping, to gain favor with Richie Aprile, Matt and Sean shot Chris and severely wounded him. Chris shot and killed Sean but Matt escaped. He was killed by Tony Soprano and Big Pussy Bonpensiero.
Former soldier in the Soprano crew, worked alongside Johnny Boy Soprano. Unlike many of his contemporaries he was able to retire from "the business". He suffered from hiccups for an entire year (approximately) and contemplated suicide. Pat is the uncle of Tony Blundetto and Chris Moltisanti, and father of Louise Blundetto. Tony Soprano calls him Uncle Pat but they are not blood relatives. Pat's brother Al Blundetto married Quintina Pollio, Livia Soprano's sister. Pat owns a farm at 146, Route 9a, Kinderhook, Upstate New York that his nephews used to visit in the summers of their youth. Several bodies were buried on the farm - Tony, Tony B., and Chris dug them up and moved them in 2004, as he was planning to sell the farm, and move to Florida, which he later does. In the series finale, Pat is seen visiting a decrepit Junior Soprano in a New Jersey mental facility. He there encounters Janice, whom he suspects is attempting to con Junior into giving her the last of his money. Pat later visits Tony at the Bada Bing to report Janice's suspicious behavior, before going back to Florida.
An associate of Christopher Moltisanti and a heroin addict. Christopher enlisted him to accommodate the Italian hitmen provided to Tony for the hit on Rusty Millio. Corky was chosen primarily because he speaks Italian and would therefore be able to communicate effectively with the hitmen. Christopher paid him for the job with heroin. Corky performed well, delivering weapons and instructions at a remote spot without revealing much about himself, and the hit went smoothly. Christopher delivered the second half of Corky's payment at the Feast of St. Elzear and included more heroin as a substitute for some of the money. Corky injected the drug in Christopher' car, which initially prompted Christopher to encourage him to get into rehab. However, Christopher was eventually tempted into joining him.
Corky Caporale.
In 2007, in the episode "The Blue Comet," now after Christopher's death, the Soprano Family used Corky again through Patsy Parisi. The target this time was Phil Leotardo, but Corky was not as successful. The hit was botched badly and Yaryna, Phil's housemaid and mistress, and her elderly father, who looked remarkably like Phil, are killed instead. When Corky heard from the hitmen that the man spoke Ukrainian to his daughter, he mumbled "whatever." However, he did ask Patsy Parisi if Phil spoke Ukrainian.
He served as a driver and bodyguard for Tony as a soldier of the Soprano crime family in 2004. In the episode "Irregular Around the Margins," Frankie was one of the parties that restrained Christopher when he came after Tony with a gun at the Bing (Frankie threatened to break him like a wishbone during this incident). Frankie also accompanied Tony, Silvio and Christopher to a tense sit-down with Johnny Sack, Phil Leotardo and Jimmy Petrille shortly after Tony Blundetto killed Billy Leotardo. It is his wife's house that Tony, Carlo and others stay at while in hiding from Phil Leotardo.
Soldier of Paulie Gualtieri crew who accompanied him on a robbery of Colombian drug dealers in 2006. Shot a Colombian who was trying to stab Paulie. Later seen visiting Tony as he recovered from his shooting at the hands of Junior Soprano, his uncle. Cary helped Paulie and Chris intimidate the EMT Tony believed took cash from him as he was brought into the hospital.
Brendan Filone.
Brendan Filone, played by Anthony DeSando, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series "The Sopranos".
On "The Sopranos", Brendan Filone was Christopher Moltisanti's friend and partner in crime and an associate of Tony Soprano. Brendan was addicted to crystal meth, and often used it with Christopher. In the episode "46 Long", Brendan and Christopher hijacked a Comley Trucking truck and stole a number of DVD players. Comley Trucking was under the protection of Uncle Junior, who demanded restitution. At a sit down, Uncle Junior tells Tony to keep Brendan and Christopher's "loose cannon" behavior under control. In a nightclub, Brendan tries his best to convince Chris to neglect Tony and Uncle Junior since they were both being denied a rise. Early the next morning, Brendan urges Chris to get ready for the next heist, a truckload of high-end Italian suits. Christopher tells him that he has decided to go along with the rules instead.
Always high on crystal meth and unable to comply with orders, Brendan, this time without Christopher, hijacks another Comley truck with two cohorts. In the process, the driver of this second truck is accidentally shot and killed by a ricochet bullet when one of the thugs drops his gun. Once Tony learns about this mishap, Brendan and Christopher receive a lecture about leadership and are ordered to return the truck to Comley. However, Uncle Junior isn't satisfied. Mikey Palmice and Livia Soprano both give Uncle Junior advice on the matter. Because of this, Junior orders that Christopher receive a mock execution — and a real one for Brendan. Brendan is shot clean through the eye ("Moe Greene special") while in his bathtub by Uncle Junior's trigger man, Mikey Palmice, as Junior stands by. This scene is inter-cut with Meadow's recital, allowing her choir's version of the lullaby "All Through the Night" to decorate the violence.
In the aftermath, Christopher and Adriana find Brendan's body in his bathtub and Christopher calls for harsh retaliation against Palmice. Tony decides to confront his uncle and Mikey for their punishing methods by beating Mikey to the ground and stapling him with some tickets. He then goes to have a sit-down with Uncle Junior for his orders.
Anthony DeSando's last onscreen appearance as Brendan Filone was in the first-season episode "The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti." He is one of the main concentrations on television when Jeffrey Wernick is interviewed about the murder charges. Wernick reveals that Filone was a loyal soldier and associate and his murder was as yet unsolved from the eyes of a federal agent. The amount of media attention and coverage Brendan receives after his murder makes Christopher annoyed and jealous. Even Georgie says that he is amazed to have known Brendan.
Later, when Jimmy Altieri attends a funeral, he notifies Uncle Junior of how sad Brendan Filone's mother was at his funeral. Junior reciprocates by telling Mikey and Chuckie about Jimmy's remark, noting that this is the kind of things they are talking about behind his back, namely the "Brendan Filone hit."
Later, in retaliation for the attempted hit on Tony, Mikey Palmice is killed after Chris and Paulie Gualtieri chase him down while he is jogging. Mikey tries to blame all the recent events on Junior, even Brendan's death, but Chris replies, "My friend Brendan, you shot him in his bathtub naked, no chance to run." Paulie and Chris then execute Mikey, leave him dead in the woods.
In season two, after Christopher is shot by Sean Gismonte and Matthew Bevilaqua, he has a near-death experience in the hospital where he goes to "hell" and explains that he saw Brendan Filone and Mikey Palmice playing cards with a bunch of Roman soldiers and Irish men. Chris also mentions that Brendan and Mikey are friends in hell although they were enemies when alive. Paulie assumes that Chris went to purgatory and tries to reassure him that it isn't as bad as hell, although Paulie becomes obsessed with his own fears of ghosts. With the exception of Paulie's concern, most of the other Soprano crew chalk up Christopher's experience as a hallucination.
An Italian associate of Furio Giunta. Accompanied Furio to Sean and Matt's apartment to collect money for Tony Soprano. They also intimidated the two into giving them $1000. Furio and Gaetano joked about the two, speaking Italian so Sean and Matt did not understand. It is unknown how long Giarizzo stayed in the country or his role in the family as he has not appeared since. Sean Gismonte refers to Gaetano as "greaseball wop."
Sean Gismonte, is an associate of the DiMeo crime family. He was Matthew Bevilaqua's partner in crime and an associate in the Gualtieri crew in 2000. Sean and Matt worked with Christopher at various aspects of organized crime including: the Massarone Construction site, a stock firm that was responsible for a Pump and Dump on the website Webistics, Junior Soprano's executive card game, and some burglary jobs with Matthew and Chris. Looking to move up in the ranks, Sean and Matt attempted a hit on Christopher as an attempt to win favor from Richie Aprile. The hit was botched and Sean was killed in the ensuing gun battle.
Corky is a Soprano associate who mainly acts as an arsonist who is skilled at making the cause of his work appear accidental. He assisted Silvio in starting the fire which burned down Artie's restaurant in 1999. Tony later suspected that Ralph Cifaretto had hired Corky to light numerous fires, including the fire at the stables which killed Pie-O-My, a horse owned by Ralph that Tony took great interest in.
Bissell, also known as Petey, was part of the group Little Paulie took to vandalize Carmine Lupertazzi's restaurant in the HUD dispute. Petey made his bones (along with Benny Fazio) by killing Stanley Johnson and Credenzo Curtis, on orders from Christopher Moltisanti. Petey/Bissell is often seen at Satriale's. He was sweeping up at Satriale's when Tony returned after recovering from his injury and later showed Phil Leotardo into the room. He continued his role as a doorman, admitting Anthony Infante to his meeting with Tony at the Bada Bing.
Thomas "Tommy Mac" Maccarato is an associate of Moltisanti who has inside info on a truck containing Pokémon cards. It is unknown whenever the hijacking took place. Thomas Maccarato didn't appear in any other episode of the series.
Former soldier in the Soprano crew. Died in the mid-1970s, Married to Joanne Moltisanti née Blundetto, father of Christopher and cousin to Carmella. Dickie was in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War and later served time in prison, making it unlikely that he spent much time with his family when he was alive. Dickie was killed during Christopher's infancy, right outside the house while bringing TV trays home. In 2002, Tony Soprano told Christopher that Dickie's killer was Detective Lt. Barry Haydu, who had just retired from the force. Tony delivered Haydu to Christopher Moltisanti as a part of his process of bonding Chris to him and slowly easing him up the family hierarchy. However, when confronted by Christopher, Haydu denied ever having heard of Dickie Moltisanti and claimed that someone was "obviously" setting him up; however, he inadvertently admitted knowing Dickie Moltisanti by stating "Look, whoever told you I had anything to do with his death is lying!", before Christopher ever mentioned Dickie's death, whom Haydu supposedly didn't even know. Haydu's last words are "I'm sorry!" indicating that he was likely indeed responsible.
Richard "Dickie" Moltisanti.
Tony remembers Dickie as a "stand up guy" and describes a lot of his positive qualities to Christopher. Dickie once took on a whole crew from New England and brought the war home to their turf. Tony also remembers that Dickie was killed because of a beef with Jilly Ruffalo, a man he knew in prison. Jilly murdered Dickie's cell mate and Dickie gouged out his eye in revenge.
According to Christopher, Dickie also struggled with problems of alcoholism and drug addiction.
Phillip is a soldier and Patsy Parisi's identical twin brother, who was born eleven minutes after him in Bloomfield, New Jersey. He is also Tony Soprano's cousin on his mother's side. He does not like the city of Boston, Massachusetts calling it "Scranton with Clams". Phillip alludes that he has been a fugitive in the past by telling Gigi about saving money where he can when wanted by the police, but it is never mentioned what he was a fugitive from. The two brothers were extremely close and Phillip would follow his brother into a life of organized crime in the DiMeo crime family. He is also the uncle to Patrick Parisi and coy with revealing mob information. He is executed by Gigi Cestone in early March 2000, when Philly picked-up and drove Gigi home from the Newark Liberty International Airport in his Cadillac Fleetwood. Tony Soprano ordered the hit to silence rumours (which in reality was factual gossip of Tony's troubled personal life at the time) that "Spoons" had been spreading that Tony had tried to suffocate Livia Soprano. Philly also later appeared in one of Tony's dreams while he was suffering from food poisoning. Tony was shown to be sorry and regretted having him killed. His death is thought to be an attempted carjacking as reported by police in the news.
Phillip "Philly Spoons" Parisi.
A flashback of Gigi killing Philly is shown in "Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood".
Former soldier in the DiMeo family; he was possibly in the Soprano crew as Johnny Soprano knew him although Tony Soprano said he didn't know him well and Febby thought his name was "Teddy" not Tony. He was possibly in the Aprile crew as Tony said Jackie Aprile, Sr. knew him really well, and they served time together in Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary. He entered the Witness Protection Program after he informed on a lot of people from the DiMeo family to the FBI which led to convictions, allegedly that of Jackie Aprile, Sr. But he was eventually kicked out of the program. He later becomes a bonded and certified travel agent who is the proprietor of his own agency outside of Waterville, Maine. He promoted cruise line trips and train excursions. Tony recognized him living under the false name "Frederick 'Fred' Peters" while visiting Colby College in Waterville, Maine with Meadow. Tony waits for Febby to leave his place of business, a travel agency, and when he does, Tony strangles him to death with a piece of wiring, leaving his body in front of his business, to signify that the Mafia had found him, and it was not just a random killing.
Fabian "Febby" Petrulio.
Febby was an amateur wood sculptor, a skill he learned in a prison wood-shop, but had a problem carving lifelike lips. Christopher says he thought Febby's bust of Frank Sinatra was actually that of Shaquille O'Neal, and Tony realizes he's found Febby when he sees a bust of Ronald Reagan in his office with very large lips. At the time of his murder, Febby had a daughter who was around the age of Meadow Soprano, and a younger daughter. At the time of his death he was remarried, and had served as a volunteer fireman, and dealt some drugs locally. He had the chance to shoot Tony the previous day while accompanying his daughter to an orientation day at Colby College but cancels the plan because of the presence of two elderly bystanders outside their motel room. While Tony is garroting him, he lies and tries to use Meadow's presence as an excuse for not shooting him, but Tony doesn't care and kills him anyway.
In the Sopranos Scriptbook by David Chase the scene where Tony kills Febby plays out differently. In the printed version Tony orders him to drop the gun once he has the wire around his neck (in the episode he simply drops it) and their conversation is longer with Petrulio pleading that he has kids to which Tony replies "other guys got kids and they took the time". It is also left unclear until the last second as to whether Tony will kill him or not as his pleadings result in Tony relaxing his grip on the wire. Febby then tries to pull away which results in Tony losing his temper and killing him. Comparing this version to the final one, it is possible to see the edits made to achieve the final version.
George "Georgie" Santorelli is a bartender at the Bada Bing. He was occasionally involved in the crime family's activities, including helping Christopher move the body of Emil Kolar, a Czech-American mobster Christopher had whacked in the pilot episode, and also swept the Bing for bugs following rumors of federal indictments. He was well liked by Silvio Dante, who owns the club.
George "Georgie" Santorelli.
Georgie lets Bada Bing strippers change from dancing on the poles to working in the VIP room, where they make at least $500, but charges them $50 and oral sex. This is seen in the season 3 episode "University".
While Georgie seems harmless, affable, and compliant, it appears as if he is somewhat slow mentally. Georgie's mental impediments would later make him the catalyst for many of Tony Soprano's sudden, violent outrages in a few different situations, as he had a tendency to exhibit excessive incompetence and spout inappropriate commentary at the worst times, which leads to Tony beating him with objects: Tony repeatedly hitting him over the head with the phone when he kept repeating "Hello?", the Big Mouth Billy Bass for being reminded of the death of Big Pussy, the ice tray for wasting ice, and the cash register drawer for when he says, "That's why ya gotta live for today" when Tony is discussing the potential mass murder that could be caused by further Al Qaeda attacks. In "University", Georgie is also hit in the eye by a chain while Ralph Cifaretto is emulating a scene from the 2000 film "Gladiator". After Tony hits him repeatedly over the head with the cash drawer causing permanent ear damage, Georgie says he is quitting. However, it appears he is convinced to stay or return to work as Georgie can later be seen working back at the Bing in season 6.
A friend and AA sponsor of Christopher Moltisanti, "Murmur" is reportedly an expert at forging documents. Attended Raymond Curto's funeral, to Tony Soprano's chagrin. He has also shown that he has the ability to do some muscle work as well, as seen by his and Benny Fazio's quick kidnapping of J.T. Dolan. Present at Christopher's pitch meeting for Christopher's movie project "Cleaver". Also with Christopher at an AA meeting when the crew first learned of Vito Spatafore's homosexuality, although Tony dismissed "Murmur" from the back-room discussion of the news at the Bada Bing. James earned the moniker "Murmur" for having a heart murmur during child birth. He was once friends with a Vietnam War veteran that drank formaldehyde just to get high.
James "Murmur" Zancone.
"Murmur" made Christopher's rounds while Christopher was in LA - buying credit card numbers from a pizza parlor and from Hillel at the Teittleman's hotel, then selling the numbers to Mohammed and Ahmed at the Bada Bing. "Murmur" also went out to LA to meet Christopher because Christopher was "chipping" (relapsing). While there, "Murmur" and Christopher tried to intimidate Ben Kingsley and robbed Lauren Bacall of a gift basket she received at an awards ceremony. "Murmur" later attended Christopher' belated bachelor party at Nuovo Vesuvio and continued to hang out with the crew at Satriale's. "Murmur" was skeptical of the benefits of Christopher's relationship with fellow addict Julianna Skiff, warning Christopher that it could be enabling (to relapse into substance abuse), and of the possibility of Tony finding out about his recent slip at the Feast of St. Elzear. He was also responsible for informing Tony that Phil Leotardo had a heart attack - Tony had warmed to him a little by this point and rewarded him with a club soda.
In 2007, in the episode "The Blue Comet," "Murmur" (unknowingly) informed Paulie and Silvio, by showing them a newspaper article on the murders of two civilians, that Phil Leotardo is still alive and the job to kill him failed because the hitmen had misidentified their target.
Father of Bobby "Bacala" Baccalieri. Soldier in Junior Soprano's crew in his younger days, he owned and worked part-time in a barber shop cutting hair, the shop was a front for his illegal businesses, he sold it after he retired from the family. In "Soprano Home Movies", Tony mentioned to Bobby's son how it was unusual that he never whacked anyone, considering his father was "the fuckin Terminator in that respect", suggesting Bobby, Sr. was responsible for numerous homicides before his retirement. He told Bobby Jr. that he didn't want him involved in the life and wished that he could have just stayed in the shop and cut hair. Returned to New Jersey from semi-retirement in 2000. Suffered from lung cancer after a lifelong smoking habit. In "Another Toothpick", Tony Soprano gave him the task of killing Salvatore "Mustang Sally" Intile. The hit was ordered as retribution for the savage unprovoked beating of Bryan Spatafore, brother of Vito Spatafore. Vito was a made man in the Aprile crew at the time. Mustang Sally was Robert's godson but he felt he had always been a problem so he had no reservations about the job and was glad to be of use. Despite his poor health and shortness of breath on exertion, he was able to overwhelm and kill the much younger Mustang Sally and his friend Carlos. Died after choking on blood brought on from his lung and losing control of his car and crashing into a sign post while leaving the scene of his final hit.
Tommy is an elderly soldier in Junior Soprano's crew who is responsible for looking after him as his dementia worsens. He allows Junior to wander out of the house. Mikey Palmice mentions to Jackie Aprile, Sr. that a mobster named Tommy DiPalma is suffering from brain cancer at the same time Jackie is suffering from stomach cancer. It is never made clear if these are two different DiPalmas.
Salvatore Intile, nicknamed "Mustang Sally" for the 1989 Ford Mustang convertible he drives. He's the godson of Robert Baccalieri, Sr. He dated Tina Francesco, who was an exotic dancer at the Bing and a friend of Adriana La Cerva. Although he is a godson, Salvatore calls him "Uncle Bobby." He is verbally and physically abusive and very possessive with his girlfriends and suffers from anger management problems. Ralph Cifaretto says that Salvatore threw a hot dog vendor off the second floor mezzanine at Giants Stadium for serving too many onions on his hot dog. He is callous and has a morbid sense of humor, joking about the attack on Bryan Spatafore with Baccalieri, Sr. Tina and Mustang Sally argued in the street and when Tina urged Bryan Spatafore, of Spatafore Bros construction, who was standing by his truck waiting for a companion, to take her home, Mustang Sally hit Bryan in the forehead with a golf club and beat him to the point where he was in a coma. Bryan Spatafore's brother, Vito Spatafore, was a made man in the Aprile crew at the time. Sally, along with his friend Carlos, was killed by his godfather, Bobby Bacala, Sr. as retribution for the beating. Although it's not appreciated by his godfather, he associates with Hispanics or as Bobby Bacala Sr. calls them, "greaseballs."
Esposito is a bodyguard of Junior Soprano. Appears outside the old Vesuvio, in "Pilot" and takes part of the wiseguys mob during the Columbus Day riots in "Christopher."
Elderly soldier and former capo of Junior Soprano's crew, replacing Philly Parisi following Parisi's murder carried out by Gigi Cestone. After displaying signs of mental and physical enfeeblement that affected his capacity to run the crew's business, Junior had him replaced by Bobby Bacala.
Junior Soprano/Bacala crew associates.
Murf Lupo.
Murf is often ridculed by Junior for his slow reactions and driving like an old woman.
Anthony is a soldier in Bobby Baccalieri's crew. Alongside his captain, he collected proceeds from John Stefano's (Joey Perillo) illegal asbestos-dumping operation and delivered them to Tony Soprano. Seen in the series finale delivering what appears to be the proceeds from Bobby's last collection while Tony is on the lam from Phil Leotardo. Possibly promoted to caporegime.
Junior Soprano's Crew associate who helps Mikey Palmice in the killing of drug dealer Rusty Irish.
He is a low-level associate of Mikey Palmice and a close friend who Mikey states "is always reliable". He drives a 1985 Pontiac Firebird. Palmice uses him as an intermediary to seek out contract killers and organize a hit on Tony Soprano. Donnie's contract killers fail to fulfill the job, as there are too many witnesses which angers Junior Soprano. Donnie arrives at a clandestine meeting and after Mikey and Chucky talk to Donnie for a moment, Donnie makes a joke saying "I hear that Tony Soprano's own mother even wants him popped." Junior reacts poorly to this joke and has Mikey call Donnie back and execute him on the spot.
Beppy is an elderly soldier in the Junior Soprano crew, full name Giuseppe Scerbo. He agrees with Junior on the need to kill Pussy Malanga, and sides with Junior when Tony tries to persuade Junior into changing the location of the planned hit. Stands by Junior throughout his RICO trial, and can often be seen in the courtroom. Scerbo appears briefly in "Whoever Did This", seen walking out of the courthouse with Junior, who comments on how "You get a full chicken and it's enough to bring home and get two meals", when Junior complains how they missed the "early bird special". Later in the episode when Junior is hospitalized after falling down steps, he tells his lawyer, Harold Melvoin: "tell Beppy to bring the chicken home", signaling the possibility of early onset dementia. Beppy also visits Junior during Season 6 while Junior is committed to a state-assisted elderly facility. He is shown "kicking-up" tribute to the committed Junior, and even hatching a scheme to help Junior escape from the institution. However, because of Junior's use of debilitating prescribed medication, the plan never materializes. Joe Pucillo, the actor who portrays Beppy, is the uncle of series creator David Chase.
Chucky is a soldier in Junior Soprano's crew and a friend of Mikey Palmice. Like Tony Soprano, he is an avid yachtsman and boater who owns a runabout which he keeps moored at a Liberty Landing Marina located in Jersey City, New Jersey on the Hudson River. Once it was confirmed that Junior and Palmice organized the failed hit on Tony, the sentiment was that Junior would want to finish what he started. At this point, Tony decided to retaliate. Being that Mikey was now "too high up," the thought was that Chucky would be the most likely person to pull the trigger the next time around. As such, he was taken by surprise at a marina, while in his small boat, and killed by Tony when he reveals a hidden gun in a fish he was carrying and shoots Chucky several times in the chest. Tony and Silvio Dante take Signore's corpse out on his runabout and dispose of it. Mikey's wife, JoJo Palmice, doesn't like Chucky, calling him a "sick fuck."
Cestone's actual first name is never mentioned, although "Gigi" is a derivation of the names "Gianluigi" and "Luigi." Former soldier in the Junior Soprano crew, defected to Tony Soprano's crew in 2000 following the execution of Philly Parisi (the acting capo of Junior's crew while Junior was incarcerated). The hit was ordered by Tony as revenge for Philly spreading rumors about Tony's mother with regard to Tony and Junior's feud. It is suggested that he was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts but later moved to New Jersey and has relatives there that he sees when he is a wanted fugitive. Gigi was picked up by Philly from the airport, and Philly drove him home. Before exiting the car, Gigi shot Philly twice in the head and, deafened by his own gunshots, made off in another vehicle being driven by Paulie Walnuts. Gigi was quickly made part of the inner circle of Tony's crew unlike fellow new member Patsy Parisi. Gigi faced some awkward moments around Patsy as the latter expressed his grief over the loss of his own twin brother Philly.
Aprile crew associates.
Gigi Cestone.
Gigi made a final transition in the fall of 2000 when he was promoted to the position of capo over the Aprile crew, following Richie Aprile's "disappearance" making him the only made guy in the Soprano crime family to serve in three different crews. He wasn't well received by most of his new crew (Donny K, Vito Spatafore, and Eugene Pontecorvo). Ralph Cifaretto took every opportunity to make his life difficult as he had hoped to receive the promotion himself and, Cestone showed clear dislike of Cifaretto. It was also Gigi's idea to have Bobby Bacala, Sr. perform the hit on Mustang Sally, in the episode, "Another Toothpick"; though Tony backs him up on this, both Junior and Ralph feel this shows questionable judgment on Gigi's part.
In a flashback scene in the episode, "...To Save Us All From Satan's Power", Gigi accompanied Junior to a sit-down with acting boss, Jackie Aprile, Sr., in 1995 following Junior's hijackings of Jackie's trucks.
Gigi died in the episode "He Is Risen", from the undue stress of putting his children through college and trying to control a resentful and recalcitrant Ralphie. He suffered a fatal heart attack while constipated on the toilet in his social club. His crew found his body and called an ambulance but he was dead on arrival. Ralph was subsequently made captain of Gigi's old crew.
Associate/soldier in DiMeo crime family. Was at The Bing for Richie Aprile's homecoming after being released from Greenhaven. He knew Richie Aprile before he was incarcerated. Gave Richie Aprile an envelope of money and told him he has children and was now recently made a grandfather. He is given insults by Paulie because of his massive height (the actor Squicciarini that plays Cippolina stands at 6'5) and massive weight and says that Frank is a "medical curiosity". He got into a short verbal altercation with Paulie Walnuts, commenting on how Cippolina's envelope of money is probably filled with single dollar bills and insulting Paulie's mother. While doing this and Pussy Bompensiero tells Big Frank to "get lost."
Bobby was a member of Richie Aprile's crew, who talked to the man who had trash dumped in the driveway by a dump truck. The man complained about prices and service, so they dumped trash in the driveway of his deli thinking "he wanted it back". While the business is called "Zanone Bros. Private Carting", Bobby is the only Zanone brother ever seen. Albert Barese informs Tony that city councilman Joseph Zachary from Raritan Township, New Jersey has information that a distraught deli owner is threatening to inform the Environmental Protection Agency about Gigi Cestone, Ralph Cifaretto and Albert Barese's stranglehold in the garbage contracting business. Tony tells Richie to deal with the deli owner quietly so as not to attract police attention.
Robert "Bobby Zanone" Coniglio.
The character is portrayed by Vito Antuofermo, the former undisputed Middleweight Boxing Champion of the world (1979–1980) and a member of the Boxing Hall of Fame.
"Redneck" and associate of the Soprano family, he met Christopher Moltisanti when he returned from the Westchester neighbourhood of Raleigh, North Carolina with a hijacked cigarette load. Along with Dante Greco, explained to Christopher how his fiancee Adriana La Cerva was in a car accident with Tony Soprano the night before at 2 am. Helped Frankie Cortese restrain Christopher when he showed up at the Bing with a gun looking for Tony. Escorted Chris to the field with Cortese where Tony almost shot him. Corky fails to mention that the hijacked load does not have the tax stamps on the cigarette cartons which are confiscated at the border by ATF, which puts Christopher in trouble with Tony. Christopher explains that they were supposed to put the tax stamps on themselves. Following this incident, Paulie supervises the cigarette smuggling operation.
Peter "Beansie" Gaeta was a former associate of Richie Aprile from Elizabethtown, New Jersey, supervising a drug operation for him. Upon Richie's release from prison, he tracked down Gaeta at his pizza parlor, Beansie's Pizzeria, and demanded payment allegedly still owed to him for his financial support. After Gaeta denied the validity of the debt, Richie first broke a hot pot of coffee over Beansie's head, gave him a serious beating, and later on ran him over with his car, rendering Beansie hospitalized and paraplegic from his injuries (in "Toodle Fucking-Oo"). Tony Soprano later gave a reluctant Beansie a large envelope of cash in compensation, insisting he could donate it to the Spinal Injury Foundation. Now using a wheelchair, Beansie moved down to open a supper club in Miami. He had evidently remained in contact with Tony Soprano: he helped set up a meeting between Tony and fellow Miami resident, Little Carmine Lupertazzi; socialized with Tony and Paulie Gualtieri when the two went on the lam (in "Remember When"); and in 2007 secured AJ Soprano a job in his New Jersey pizzeria.
Soldier in the Aprile crew, first seen taking delivery of cigarettes from Christopher Moltisanti on his return from North Carolina. Often seen in the back at Satriale's Meat Market. Visited Benny Fazio in hospital after his beating by Phil Leotardo. Brought Tony a glass of water and helped take his shoes off when he collapsed while arriving at Allegra Sacrimoni's wedding. Later at the wedding Dante brings drinks for the Soprano family and even dances with Rosalie Aprile. He shares the same nickname as real-life Lucchese crime family mob associate Joe Manri who was involved in the 1978 Lufthansa heist.
Dante "Buddha" Greco.
Dante accompanied Benny Fazio and Terry Doria to look for Vito Spatafore at his goomah's beach house following the revelation that Vito was possibly a homosexual. Dante's mother suffered from, and eventually died of, Lupus, which caused Dante to consider a career in healthcare. He was seen playing pool in the back room of the Bada Bing when Anthony Infante informed Tony that Johnny Sack had died in a prison hospital of lung cancer. As of the final season, Dante has been acting as Tony's personal driver and bodyguard. He was last seen driving Tony and guarding the safe-house door in the final episode, "Made In America".
As his upper arm prominently features a tattoo of the bass clef, Dante may be presumed to be a player of the bass or another instrument which uses the bass clef.
Kevin "Dogsy" Interdonato is an associate/soldier in the Aprile crew. Dogsy helped Vito Spatafore beat up the Soprano family's appraiser on the HUD scam restoring his loyalties to them.
"Donny K." is a soldier of the Aprile crew. He was first was seen in 2000 introducing Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte to Richie Aprile. Donny was known to be a high-ranking soldier and one of Richie's best men. Often seen at the crew's social club and at private parties at the Bada Bing. Present when Gigi Cestone died at the social club. Donny is a member of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America in Local 623 and held one of the "no work" carpenter jobs on the Esplanade construction site for the Aprile crew. One night while having a drink at a bar in Little Italy in Manhattan, Johnny Sack spots Donny sitting diagonally across from him on the right side of the bar. Ralph Cifaretto had recently made a disparaging joke regarding Johnny's obese wife Ginny. Johnny and Donny make eye contact as Donny is laughing and amusingly cutting up with the bartender. Since Johnny knows Donny works for Ralph and assumes he is laughing and conversing about the joke Ralph made about Ginny, Johnny begins to grow angry. He then follows Donny outside the bar to his car. Donny is then attacked and beaten unconscious by Johnny. After the intense beating, Johnny proceeds to urinate on Donny. Donny is known to have received some nerve damage from the beating and has not been seen since. Donny was unmarried and had to take care of his mother. Tony was angered at Johnny, since he likes Donny and he is a respected man.
Member of the Aprile crew. He becomes the executor of Joe "Peeps" Peparelli's estate and affairs. It seems that Joe has no surviving family or relatives. Jason arranges to have a headstone made following his death - but failed to have Peparelli's name correctly spelled, the final product being simply "Joseph Peeps." Silvio defended Jason at Joey Peeps funeral for the mistake, explaining to Tony that Jason was dyslexic. Tony replies, "What's that got to do with it?" Accompanied Vito when passing on information about the Colombian drug money heist in 2006. Stood guard outside the ICU as Tony recovered from his gunshot. Later took part in a card game at Satriale's that took place as Tony rejoined the crew. Jason helped to break up an altercation between Paulie Gualtieri and Bobby Baccala at the Feast of St. Elzear festival. He helped Little Paulie steal tools from Al Lombardo's hardware store in 2007, done under orders from Paulie Gualtieri.
Jackie Aprile Jr. and Dino Zerilli's friend and partner in crime on the robbery of Eugene Pontecorvo's low stakes Saturday night card game. Carlo was recruited because he owned a large shotgun. He was killed during the robbery by Christopher Moltisanti with a shot between the eyes.
Brother of Vito Spatafore, and partner in Spatafore Bros Construction. When Tony insisted to Richie Aprile that he build a wheelchair ramp on Beansie Gaeta's house (since it was Richie who put Beansie in the wheelchair in the first place), Richie sent Vito and Bryan over there to get this done (despite the Gaetas' protests).
Bryan Spatafore.
Bryan was put into a coma by Mustang Sally, in the episode entitled, "Another Toothpick," when Sally's girlfriend had turned to him for help after she and Sally had fought, he was beaten mercilessly with a golf putter, and expected to remain a "vegetable". In the episode, "The Ride," Tony briefly mentions to Carmela that Bryan made some repairs at Satriale's. Even though this statement was most likely a lie on Tony's part (to cover up the real reason for his ankle injury in that episode), it was the first sign that Bryan awoke from his coma and recovered from his beating. Upon Vito's return to New Jersey, Bryan, apparently armed, watchdogged his brother's meeting with Tony and later attended a family dinner. As he remained silent throughout, it is unclear if Bryan has sustained brain damage from the assault, although his eyesight seems to have suffered.
Sunshine was the dealer for Tony Soprano's high stakes, all night, executive card game in 2000. He is extremely talkative in a very monotone voice and dispenses metaphors and famous quotes while acting as a card dealer. Sunshine was also dealing for Eugene Pontecorvo's Saturday night low stakes game in 2001 when Jackie Aprile, Jr. and his friends tried to rob the game. Sunshine continued to shout sayings and proverbs after the robbers told him to be quiet, causing Jackie to panic and shoot him.
"Sunshine".
It is implied he was an employee of the Aprile crew who dealt regularly at their illegal card games.
Dino was a childhood friend of Jackie Aprile, Jr. and partner in crime and an associate in Ralph Cifaretto's crew. He helps Jackie Jr. with the disruptive Hispanics at Pizzaland. Dino is the one who holds onto Jackie's handgun after Jackie Jr. threatens the Hispanics with it. Like Jackie Jr. and Carlo Renzi he feels that Ralph Cifaretto is holding them back from their full potential. He looks up in admiration to Christopher Moltisanti who was at that point in time a rising figure in the DiMeo crime family. After quickly picking up his bad habits along with Jackie Jr., he gets arrested for a short period of time. When he is released, Jackie gives him the lowdown. Dino resists at first but later decides to comply with Jackie Jr.'s scheme to rob Eugene Pontecorvo's low-stakes card game in order to gain the respect of the higher level mobsters. They team up with Carlo Renzi, who wields a heavy shotgun. Things do not go their way when Sunshine gets whacked during the robbery, triggering a barrage of gunshots from both sides. This scuffle leaves Carlo dead and Furio wounded. Dino and Jackie Jr. run for the street, but their getaway wheelman, Matush, had fled out of fear after hearing the gunshots. Jackie boosts an oncoming car and high-tails it out of the area, leaving Dino to face an angry Christopher Moltisanti and Albert Barese. Dino tries to level with them by mentioning he's with Ralph, but that does not help. Chris and Albert promptly shoot Dino in the face, killing him.
He is a paternal cousin of Larry Boy Barese; acting capo of the Barese crew when Larry Boy was in jail; soldier in the Barese crew.
Barese crew associates.
Albert "Ally Boy" Barese.
When Richie Aprile wanted to make a move against Tony Soprano, he approached Albert (who was acting capo at the time) for support, expecting sympathy since both of them had asked Tony for control over garbage routes and been rejected. Albert declined. Once Junior found out Richie couldn't get Albert's support, he decided it was in his best interest to side with Tony instead of Richie. As such, Junior informed Tony about Richie's intent to make a move against him.
The crew's contest for the routes continued as Albert was briefly involved in a "garbage war" with Ralph Cifaretto. This dispute disturbed Tony a great deal, primarily because it was making headlines due to the fires being set by those involved. Tony thought he settled the dispute between the two at a stand-up meeting in his backyard, in which Tony said, "No more fires." But Ralph continues to battle Albert, dispatching two men to severely beat one of Albert's garbage workers, smugly telling them: "Remember, Tony said no more fires."
Interestingly, the FBI thought this "war" was likely the cause of Richie Aprile's "disappearance."
Albert was also at Eugene Pontecorvo's card game when Jackie Aprile, Jr., Dino Zerilli and Carlo Renzi tried to rob it - Christopher Moltisanti and Albert caught up with Dino as he tried to run away and shot him. It was also at Albert's birthday party that the infamous "weight" remark was said by Ralphie about Ginny Sack.
Albert also has a reputation for repeating, verbatim, whatever is said to him in a conversation by the person speaking to him (Paulie refers to Albert as "The parakeet"). Albert was also outspoken with Silvio and Patsy, "off the record," about his suspicion (which he was correct about, unbeknownst to him), that it was in fact Tony that assassinated Ralphie over a horse. Albert was a good earner while Larry Boy was away. Silvio once commented to Paulie that Albert was bringing in more than he (Paulie) was.
Soldier in the Barese Crew.
Nicholas "Nicky Spags" Spagnelli.
Seen celebrating at the hospital, with other members of the crew, after Tony Soprano awakes from his coma.
Former capo in the DiMeo/Soprano crime family. Present at Christmas celebrations in 1995, in a flashback scene in the episode, "...To Save Us All From Satan's Power."
Altieri/Gervasi crew associates.
James "Jimmy" Altieri.
James "Jimmy" Altieri is a caporegime in the DiMeo Crime Family. Jimmy possesses many similar characteristics to his peers such as Big Pussy Bonpensiero. He has thick black hair and is obese, as Tony noted the informants were 'two fat fucks with black hair'. Jimmy first appears on the show in the episode "Meadowlands" at a "Captain's Dinner", discussing Junior. Jimmy had to have been a capo since at least 1995 because he appears in a flashback sequence during a 95' Christmas Party celebration in the season 3 episode "...To Save Us All From Satan's Power". In the episode "Nobody Knows Anything", Jimmy was arrested for gun charges while running an illegal card game. The FBI found pool tables full of guns. Tony tells Jimmy that he missed his calling and that he should have been a criminal lawyer demonstrating his law savvy, instead of a mobster but Jimmy says "enough people already hate me." He was probably "flipped" at this time, although it was never proven. Big Pussy Bonpensiero was also present and arrested but was already working for the feds at this point (Agent Skip Lipari stated he had been with them since 1998. Although, it is interesting to note that Tony thinks Pussy "flipped" in 1995). Very little is known about Altieri, for his existence on the show is brief and is rarely emphasized in the episodes in which he does appear. Jimmy was married to Franni Altieri and had a son, James Altieri Jr., revealed in "Commendatori". Jimmy and Tony were the youngest captains.
Vin Makazian, Tony's inside detective (who works clandestinely for Tony and does his dirty work from time to time, which included observing Dr. Melfi), informs Tony that Big Pussy Bonpensiero is "wired for sound" (that is he is an informant). Tony finds this very difficult to believe. Shortly after Jimmy's arrest, he is released. He shows up one night at Tony's home during dinner. He and Tony walk into the basement where Jimmy begins asking Tony a lot of questions, making Tony very suspicious. Tony finds Jimmy's behavior very peculiar and also believes he was released too promptly after his arrest. Tony then begins to suspect that Makazian mistook Jimmy for Pussy as they are similar in appearance. Pussy abruptly disappears after being confronted by Paulie Gualtieri. Earlier in the episode, Vin Makazian, who had suffered from chronic depression, had committed suicide by jumping off a bridge, so Tony was not able to confirm whether Vin had confused Jimmy and Pussy. Tony decides to go with his instincts and decides that Jimmy is an informant. At a meeting with other administrators and capos, it is apparent to everyone else Jimmy is acting somewhat odd. As such, Uncle Junior sanctioned a hit on Jimmy and said he wanted a message to be sent. Christopher lured Jimmy to a hotel room in Times Square with a beautiful Russian girl as bait. Once Jimmy was seated in the room, Silvio came in and put a gun to the back of his head. Jimmy realized what was about to happen and went for a gun in his ankle holster, but Christopher beat him to it. Christopher and Silvio taunt him by saying he should call for help down his microphone (a wire) - at which point Silvio shot him in the back of his head. Given that he said "Oh God" under his breath in a serious way and didn't deny being a "rat" when he was at gunpoint, it likely was true that Jimmy was an informant. As for the message, Jimmy's body was found in an alley with a rat stuffed in his mouth. Christopher even went so far as to call in a bomb threat to Jimmy's wake, to which Dante replied, "See now, that's over the top." Carlo Gervasi subsequently takes over Jimmy's abandoned crew after Jimmy's death.
Walden Belfiore was a soldier in the Gervasi crew of the DiMeo Crime Family, and played a small but pivotal role during the show's final episodes. He was named after singer Bobby Darin, born Walden Robert Cassotto. He is presumably related to Angie Bonpensiero, whose maiden name is Belfiore, though it is never stated. He was first seen accompanying Carlo Gervasi to a meeting at the Bada Bing and also visited Tony Soprano following the death of Christopher Moltisanti.
Walden Belfiore.
Later, during a discussion about Tony's experience with peyote, Walden admits to having used ecstasy, and enjoying its effects.
Walden was also a bodyguard at the safe-house when Tony goes into hiding after the death of Bobby Bacala and the incapacitation of Silvio Dante. In the final episode, Benny Fazio and Belfiore locate Phil Leotardo and Belfiore shoots Phil in the head and chest before making a getaway with Fazio.
Member/soldier of Carlo Gervasi's crew. His last name is supposedly derived from Andrea Doria, the Genoese condottiere and admiral who also had the famous vessel SS "Andrea Doria" named after him. Vito calls him "Hopalong Cassadeech", a play on the television character Hopalong Cassidy. Terry is a member of the ILA and a dock foreman who is responsible for monitoring incoming shipments through New Jersey ports, and worked with Benny Fazio to track down Vespa scooters that Johnny Sack kept hidden from Tony. Part of the group that went to looking for Vito Spatafore at his comare's beach house following the revelation that he was homosexual. When Spatafore returned to town, he ran into Doria at a Stop and Shop in Hackensack, New Jersey who then asked to borrow money for child support payments. After Spatafore's death Doria was pleased to have timed his borrowing so well, knowing that since Vito Spatafore is dead he will not have to pay back any of the money he borrowed.
A younger paternal cousin to Carlo Gervasi, Burt was made a formal member of the Soprano crime family in 2006, at the same time as Phil Leotardo's soldier Gerry Torciano was made a capo in the Lupertazzi family. He lives with his wife Lorraine and toy terrier Spencer. Gerry Torciano and Burt were given a joint celebration by the New Jersey and New York families at Nuovo Vesuvio where Burt was seated between Carlo and Gerry. Burt helped Patsy to make collections shortly after he became a made man and also attended Christopher Moltisanti's belated bachelor party. In episode "Kennedy and Heidi," he is seen attending Christopher's funeral. As revealed in the episode "The Blue Comet," according to Silvio Dante, Burt was eventually swayed to take the side of the Lupertazzi Family and went to Silvio to convince him to go along in a coup d'état, but Silvio instead responded by garroting him to death in his home the next day.
Carlo Gervasi.
An elder wiseguy who grew up in the era of Feech La Manna who has risen to the rank of capo in the DiMeo crime family. After his son is arrested for drug dealing, Carlo apparently strikes a deal with the FBI, and is ready to give Grand Jury testimony against Tony in the series finale.
Ran a card game for the Altieri crew that was violently beaten up by Mikey Palmice despite being under Jimmy Altieri's protection. This occurred in 1999 shortly after Junior became acting boss and the capos felt it was a sign Junior was abusing his new position. Raymond Curto comments that Sammy wasn't paying protection to anyone in the neighbourhood. He was beaten in front of the card players while they played which is implied by Jimmy to have scared off the players from attending and having damaged Sammy and Jimmy's reputation of protection. Other than Jimmy, the crew leader, he was the only known member in the Altieri crew in 1999.
Soldier in Carlo Gervasi's crew. Responsible for monitoring incoming shipments through NJ ports.
When Tony and Bobby Bacala watch the news about the release of Tony Blundetto and Michele "Feech" La Manna in the first episode of Season 5, the news reporter states that both La Manna and Blundetto were prime suspects in the car-bomb killing of Thomas "Tommy" Gilardi and his driver. It is not mentioned whether Tommy Gilardi was a caporegime or a made guy, but the fact that he had a driver implies that Gilardi must have been a high-ranking member during the 1980s, under former boss Ercoli "Eckley" DiMeo.
In Season 5, Episode 1 ("Two Tonys"), after Christopher complains about having to pay for dinners for years Tony explains that it is a Mafia tradition of respect shown by its younger members to their older colleagues. Tony tells Christopher that when he was a newly made man, for years he had to buy dinners at Benihana and Peter Luger Steak House for Richie Aprile and Anastasia, who racked up huge tabs which included steak, brandy, cigars, and champagne. This reveals that Anastasia was a high ranking soldier or capo in the DiMeo crime family.
Jimmy was an associate of the DiMeo crime family, who doubled as a legitimate Elvis impersonator and hired entertainer. He was born and raised in Dover, New Jersey. He does not resemble the young Elvis, but has the image of how Presley appeared circa 1977 around the time of his death. Jimmy styles his hair in the classic 1950s duck tail like Dean Martin. In his home it is shown that he has a ceramic bust of Elvis. Sal Bonpensiero and Agent Skip Lipari met him in a party store somewhere in New Jersey. Pussy introduced Skip as a "friend of ours" from Delaware to make Jimmy believe that Skip was a made man and not an FBI agent. Jimmy was skeptical as he said he had never met any connected guys from Delaware. Pussy was afraid that Jimmy would tell someone about having seen him and Skip so Pussy killed him with a hammer in his own home with the ruse of hiring him for a bachelorette party. Jimmy Bones is the nickname of a mobster used in a Richard Pryor comedy skit in "That Nigger's Crazy" when Richard discusses working at a "Mafia night club" in Youngstown, Ohio.
Christopher Moltisanti tells Jon Favreau and Amy Safir the story of a wiseguy he knew, a made man who received a blowjob from a girl only to discover it was really a man. In revenge for the embarrassment the wiseguy burnt him with acid. Chris doesn't say his name at the time as he can not risk other people finding out but upon seeing that Favreau used it in his script Chris remarked "this is Joey Cipollini's story". Amy says that there is no character named Cipollini indicating this was the mobsters real name.
Rocco DiMeo was a member of the DiMeo crime family in New Jersey and feared in all of Essex County, New Jersey. Rocco was a feared mobster in his day but lost some credibility when Richie Aprile bested him in a fist fight in the 1970s and took his leather jacket trenchcoat, after this brawl, Rocco was ashamed at being beaten by Richie and left New Jersey. He was known in the area as "The Terror of Essex". He was larger than Richie in size, so he had to use the belt on it to fit commenting that he looked like Erwin Rommel. He later developed Alzheimer's. Richie later presented the jacket as a present to Tony Soprano. With Rocco's jacket on Tony, Richie says he looks like Robert Evans.
An original gangster who was "made" in Italy, Feech came over to America in the 1950s and settled in Northern New Jersey where he became involved with the DiMeo crime family, then under the leadership of boss Ercole 'Eckley' DiMeo. Paulie Walnuts calls him "The King of Breadsticks" because he owns a bakery and catering company. A contemporary of Johnny Soprano and Junior Soprano, Feech had become one of the most respected and feared capos in the DiMeo family by the 1970s. However, his status did not prevent a young Jackie Aprile, Sr. and Tony Soprano from robbing his card game, and thereby solidifying their status as rising stars in the organization. Despite Feech's anger at having been robbed, Jackie's older brother, Richie Aprile, then a high-ranking earner and soldier in the family, intervened on Tony and Jackie's behalf and got Tony and Jackie a pass. Silvio reveals they were also helped by the fact that both Johnny Soprano and Junior Soprano were powerful capos under DiMeo.
Other members of the DiMeo crime family.
Michele "Feech" La Manna.
In 1984, Feech was convicted of criminal charges and began serving a twenty-year sentence. In 2004, his sentence was up and he returned to North Jersey to, in his own words, 'get back in the game'.
Feech went to see Tony Soprano, the new boss of North Jersey, and requested his card game back, as well as permission to get back in the action. Tony acquiesced, on the condition that Feech not step on anybody's toes. However, Feech soon got into trouble. After a power struggle with Paulie Walnuts over landscaping, Feech stole cars from Dr. Ira Fried's daughter's wedding. Previously, during a card game, Tony had made it clear that Dr. Fried was a friend and was not to be touched, but Feech went ahead with his plan anyway. Tony realized that Feech still thought of him as a kid and saw Junior as the boss, paying his respects and going to Junior about complaints instead of Tony. Silvio tells Tony that Feech is well liked in the DiMeo family, which Tony sees as a threat to his status as acting boss. Tony, having learned from his experience with Richie Aprile, indicated to Silvio that things needed to be "nipped in the bud". Tony instructed Christopher Moltisanti and Benny Fazio to convince Feech to keep a truck of stolen plasma screen televisions in his garage. When a different parole officer suddenly appeared at his home and discovered the televisions, Feech was arrested, and ended up back in prison. Because of Feech's old age, it is likely he would stay in prison for the remainder of his life.
Little Pussy is an old enemy of Uncle Junior. When Junior wants to have him killed, he plans for the hit to occur in Vesuvio - Artie Bucco's restaurant. Tony, aware that this murder would destroy his friend's business, sought an alternative which would allow Artie to build a new restaurant with fire insurance money. He has been dining at Vesuvio's "his whole life", Junior tells Tony. Soon after the hit was planned, Malanga (appearing in a wheelchair) was arraigned by the authorities when he returned to New Jersey from Florida. News footage of the charges was seen by Tony's crew, so Tony acted quickly and took the advice of Hesh Rabkin to send Silvio Dante to start a fire at the restaurant so the hit must occur elsewhere.
Gennaro "Little Pussy" Malanga.
The only other significant mention of Malanga is when Tony says to Junior that he's been dead "six years now" in the Season 6 premiere episode "Members Only". However, Junior's dementia causes him to believe that Tony is Little Pussy when he shoots him in the same episode. He is loosely based on, by nickname only, New Jersey mobster Anthony "Little Pussy" Russo.
Romeo Martin was a former member of the DiMeo crime family who received $50,000 from Johnny Boy Soprano upon his release from prison to get him back on his feet. He shares the same name as a Patriarca crime family associate Romeo "Scarface" Martin who was a prime suspect behind the 1978 Blackfriars Massacre which left five people dead in Boston over a drug deal gone wrong.
Fritzie Nesti is an associate or soldier of the DiMeo crime family who Sean Gismonte knows from Hoboken, New Jersey. Christopher Moltisanti warns Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte about Silvio Dante's behavior while gambling with a story wherein Silvio was down $50,000 in a card game. At some point he sneezes and Fritzie says "salut'" Silvio thinks he says something else. Silvio then blames Fritzi for his losing streak for the rest of the game. A person named Fritzie in Boston is mentioned by Christopher in "Members Only", whether this is the same Fritzie is unclear however.
Cicci Sasso is maternal cousin to "Johnny Boy" Soprano. He is a former member of the DiMeo crime family, and was one of the mobsters meeting with Johnny Boy Soprano at an amusement park near the Soprano home Down Neck Newark in the 1960s. When the park was raided by police, Cicci attempted to escape and was shot in the kneecap, which Tony notes later disqualified him from service in the Vietnam War. His shooting is witnessed by Tony Soprano.
Kevin is a Irish-American associate of the DiMeo crime family. His picture appears on the FBI board after Junior's dinner in 1999 and is possibly one of those who were indicted at the end of season one. He shares the last name of New York heavyweight championship boxer Tom Sharkey.
As the DiMeo crime family prepared for rumored indictments to be handed down, Christopher Moltisanti grew more and more depressed with being excluded from the subsequent media frenzy. When Christopher Moltisanti was finally referred to by name in "The Star-Ledger" Richard Catuso was named as a co-conspirator in credit card scams and extortion schemes. His last name was misspelled by the newspaper, likely from the common Neapolitan last name Caruso.
Was also named in the "The Star-Ledger" as a co-conspirator in credit card scams and extortion schemes with Christopher Moltisanti.
He is a Hispanic garment truck driver for Comley Trucking - an organization under Junior Soprano's protection and constantly robbed by Soprano crew associate Brendan Filone. He was accidentally killed in a hijack attempt led by Brendan when Special K dropped his gun. His transport truck and his shipment of Italian suits, with several taken by Tony Soprano and Silvio Dante is returned by Christopher Moltisanti. The Comley Trucking foreman was an associate of Junior who tips off Moltisanti of shipments to hijack. This death enrages Junior and is resolved by executing Brendan Filone and ordering a mock execution for Christopher.
A practicing hassidic Jew who worked with his father-in-law, Shlomo Teitlemann - a hotel owner. Ariel tried to use his ending marriage to negotiate a 50% share in his hotel. Shlomo contracted the DiMeo crime family to intimidate Ariel into walking away. Ariel refused to back down despite a severe beating, death threats and finally caved at threatened castration. Ariel negotiated a 15% share to ensure an amicable divorce.
Richard "Dick" Barone owned and operated Barone sanitation - a front business for the Soprano crew that also handled their legitimate garbage hauling routes. In 1999 the Triborough Towers route was subject to a bidding war between Barone and Kolar Brothers Sanitation. Dick Barone was part of the crews discussions about the problem and was at Satriale's when Christopher Moltisanti took it upon himself to deal with the issue and murder Emil Kolar. Chris' action led to the Kolar Bros. withdrawing their bid which Dick was happy to report to Tony.
Business and front operators.
Dick Barone.
He lived in the Deer Valley neighbourhood of Princeton, New Jersey. 
In 2000, Dick attended the Garbagemen's Ball alongside "Waste Management Consultant" Tony Soprano.
Dick died a well-respected businessman in 2006 from Lou Gehrig's disease. His funeral was attended by many members of the DiMeo crime family. Dick was survived by his wife, Helen Barone, and son, Jason. Following his death, Barone Sanitation was bought out by Lupertazzi crime family firm, Cinelli Sanitation.
Victor "Vic" Caputo is the manager of Caputo's Poultry - a small business in the neighborhood around the Satriale's meat market. It's also a front, a Bookie is being run in the building. Tony Soprano is Caputo's landlord and he also pays protection to Patsy Parisi. Vic is forced to move his business when Tony sells the property in 2006. Tony had misgivings about the sale, partially due to his sense of loyalty to Vic and because Caputo's had been in the neighborhood since Tony's childhood, but eventually the offer was too high for him to resist. Vic complains to Patsy about the Jamba Juice juice company that has bought the building. He could be related to Lenny Caputo, a gangster and heroin trafficker from Rhode Island who was murdered by Lou Gallina.
Manager of a betting shop that was given to Christopher as his first piece of business after becoming a made man.
He is a nephew of Michele "Feech" La Manna who is involved in running La Manna landscaping - one of Feech's legitimate businesses. He is the brother of Jimmy La Manna and works in Paulie Walnuts' Aunt Mary's neighborhood on Franklin Boulevard in Somerset, New Jersey. However La Manna Landscaping become involved in a turf war with Paulie Gualtieri's friends gardening firm Vitro Gardening and Paulie injured Jimmy by hitting him in the head with a shovel and Gary La Manna by having him fall out of tree and most likely fracture his femur and break a shin bone from the fall. Paulie steals one of LaManna Landscaping's lawnmowers and takes all the cash from his wallet after the altercation as a "downpayment" for allowing to work in the neighbourhood. He also demands to have Salvatore Vitro's outstanding orthopedist bill (from Feech LaManna's attack) to be paid off and 10% of whatever they earn from the jobs. After negotiations with LaManna, Gualtieri and Tony LaManna's territory is staked out as being west of Dyer Avenue in Emerson, New Jersey with the rest of the city belonging to Vitro.
Feech La Manna's nephew involved in running La Manna landscaping - one of Feech's legitimate businesses for 25 years, before LaManna was sent away to prison. However, La Manna Landscaping become involved in a turf war with Paulie Walnuts' friends gardening firm Vitro Gardening and Paulie injured Gary and his brother Jimmy La Manna. He suffers a concussion after being hit with the head with a shovel and broken arm from Paulie. When arguing over the turf war Paulie claims that Jimmy ran at him with a chainsaw and that he only hit him in the head with a shovel in self-defense.
Owner of Massarone Construction, sometimes referred to as "Black" Jack Massarone. The Soprano crew had an interest in Massarone's construction company. In 2000 Jack was the unwitting victim of a shakedown - black protesters caused work to cease at one of his sites by picketing because they thought his employment policies were racist. He paid Tony Soprano to intervene on his behalf and Tony organized a gang of mob associates to break up the protest. Tony had actually orchestrated the protest through his contact Reverend James, Jr. Massarone Construction was later involved in Soprano construction schemes like the Esplanade project and HUD scam.
"Black" Jack Massarone.
In 2004, Jack had become a federal informant and wore a wire concealed in a baseball cap to several meetings with Tony. Tony realized something was wrong when he was tipped off by Patsy Parisi that one of his meetings with Massarone was staked-out by the FBI. Raising Tony's suspicions further was the fact that Massarone gave him a framed picture of the Rat Pack at that meeting, and later asked him if he had lost weight. Jack was murdered and found in the trunk of his car with a golf club cover stuffed in his mouth - a message that his killers knew he was talking to the feds.
A practicing Chassidic Jew and co-owner of The Fly Away Motel with his brother-in-law Ariel who worked there for twenty years with his father-in-law. In 1999 his brother-in-law Ariel used his ending marriage to negotiate a share in the Teitlemann's motel where he had worked for his whole life. However, Hillel's father Shlomo contracted the Soprano family to intimidate Ariel against Hillel's advice. Unfortunately for Hillel the Soprano family also got a share in the business and in 2000 Hillel was still working at the motel and facilitating their business there - prostitution and the "executive game"—a high-stakes poker game—which Hilell later complains to Paulie Walnuts and Silvio Dante about, angering them greatly due to the fact of all the business they bring the hotel. In 2006 Hillel was involved in Benny Fazio's credit card number scheme - selling card information to Soprano crew associate Murmur.
A practicing Chassidic Jew and co-owner of the Flyaway Motel by LaGuardia Airport. Father of Hillel Teitlemann. In 1999 Teitlemann hired the Soprano crew to settle a dispute with his son-in-law Ariel. His daughter wanted a divorce but Ariel would not leave without a 50% share in the business because he had spent his life working in the family motel. An amicable solution was eventually brokered - the divorce was to go through for a 15% share in the motel to the son-in-law. Because he had organized his own solution Teitlemann tried to pay the Sopranos off with cash instead of the promised share in the business - Tony refused this and insisted on his promised 25%. Teitlemann was left with not much of a better deal than before he involved the Mafia - 40% of his business still gone as opposed to the original loss of ½; but now he was partnered with the mob. The crew uses the motel for meetings, illegal business, prostitution and to host the executive game.
Maurice was an African-American college friend of Ronald Zellman at the University of Michigan. He was born and raised on Roseville Street in Newark, New Jersey, his father was a typesetter for the The Star-Ledger newspaper. He witnessed the 1967 Newark riots and did not like Mayor Hugh Addonizio or Anthony Imperiale because of their racial views. He was a follower of Eldridge Cleaver until Cleaver became violent with his protests and verbally renounced it, along with Zellman. In 2002 he was married to his second wife, an African-American woman named Lenore with two sons. He complains to Zellman about child support for children from his previous marriage. Maurice worked with charitable organizations for many years eventually becoming disillusioned and embittered by the lack of real change he effected. The Chi Lites single "Oh Girl" is his favorite song. Zellman put Maurice in touch with Tony Soprano in 2002 to work a scam defrauding the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Maurice bought houses in the Seventh Avenue, Newark, New Jersey neighborhood with the promise of cleaning them up using HUD loans; he would later default on the loans, claiming that the project had soured and walking away with a share of the money. He is a philanthropist and large supporter of charity work who sits on the board of a youth gang outreach program for troubled and homeless adolescence. He is told by Zellman to hire some delinquents to steal a car and shoot up one of the homes to clear out drug addicts and dealers operating there.
One of Brendan Filone's African-American goons involved in robbing Comley trucking shipments under the protection of Uncle Junior. His name is a derivative of the name Antoine. He accompanies Brendan and Special K on a heist even after Junior had made Brendan and Chris pay tribute for robbing his trucks. He holds his gun sideways. When Special K drops his gun and the ricochet bullet kills the truck driver, Antjuan and Special K run off, leaving Brendan to face the consequences, and ultimately, be punished.
Contracted by Junior's crew to kill Tony Soprano via intermediary Donnie Paduana. First attempt was aborted when Christopher inadvertently boxed in the car the would-be assassins were using.

The hit never took place.
An old hitman of the Atwell Avenue Crew from Rhode Island. He is a capo of a crew of semi-retired contract killers. Gallina and his crew are recommended to Tony by Uncle Junior to take out the contract on John Sacramoni. He tells Silvio and Chris that he does not like working for anyone who is involved with drugs or drug trafficking. He earned the nickname "DiMaggio" (after an Italian-American baseball legend Joe DiMaggio) for his use of a baseball bat as a murder weapon to murder his mob captain and his wife. For the murder he was sentenced to eight years in prison. Their mob captain denounced the drug trade but was dealing behind their backs while also working as an informant for the FBI. Lou also tell Chris and Silvio that he killed mobster Tommy Neri coming home from the racetrack and hit him in the head with a tire iron, and then held him down as his friend Frank cut his head off with a hacksaw. He has congenital cataracts, a condition that he has passed on to his daughter who lives with him. She is legally blind and because of his old age, it has been arranged that a priest comes to visit them for Sunday mass. Ultimately, the hit on Sacramoni did not happen.
A pair of Italian hitmen from the Naples-based Camorra with whom the Soprano family does business. Tony refers to them as the "tailors", "cousins", or "zips". They are hired to assassinate Rusty Millio as a favor to Johnny "Sack", and succeed, killing Rusty and his bodyguard, Eddie Pietro. They block them in Rusty's drive way and approach their car under the pretense of asking for directions to the Brooklyn Museum. They spend some of their earned money on expensive souvenirs and gifts which they bring back to Italy.
Italo and Salvatore.
In 2007, in the episode "The Blue Comet," Italo and fellow Neapolitan hitman Roberto are hired to assassinate Phil Leotardo. But, in a case of mistaken identity, Italo murders Yaryna, Phil's housemaid and mistress, and her elderly father, who happened to look very similar to Phil, in a brutal double homicide which is later reported in the newspapers and on television. Italo has a niece that married a Ukrainian and is therefore able to recognize the language his victims spoke. Italo informs Corky of this and comments that Yaryna was probably Leotardo's daughter as she called him "daddy."
The pair are given orders through Corky Caporale, Christopher Moltisanti's drug-addled associate, because he speaks fluent Italian, and the two speak little English.
Contracted by Junior's crew to kill Tony Soprano via intermediary Donnie Paduana. The first attempt was aborted when Christopher boxed in the car the would-be assassins were using outside a donut shop. Mickey was told by Donnie that the hired assassins "were very good," and that Tony "would get an open casket". But minutes after the aborted attempt, Junior's crew severed its link with Rasheen by killing Donnie Paduana. The next day, during the second failed hit on Tony, Rasheen accidentally shot and killed his partner William "Petite" Clayborn. Then Tony dragged Rasheen along as he drove away, eventually letting him go. He apparently escaped, driving a then-new, 1999 Ford Taurus. After the failed assassination, Tony compares them to "Boyz II Men."
One of Brendan Filone's goons involved in robbing Comley trucking shipments under the protection of Uncle Junior. He accompanies Brendan and Antjuan on a heist even after Junior had made Brendan and Chris pay tribute for robbing his trucks. He pretends to be able to drive a truck when he really can't and he accidentally drops his gun when exiting the vehicle. The gun discharged when it hit the ground and the ricochet bullet killed Hector Anthony, the driver. Special K flees the scene along with Antjuan and Brendan ends up getting punished for the accident. The name "Special K" is both a brand of Kelloggs breakfast cereal and a slang term for the drug ketamine.
Muslim associates of Christopher Moltisanti. Ahmed's full name is revealed to be Ahmed al-Najafi. They are frequent customers at the Bada Bing!. They steal money via the internet with acquired credit card information from customers of various businesses, as per the scam of Christopher and "Murmur." They later seek help from Christopher in purchasing TEC-9 semi-automatic pistols, which they claim they need "for a family matter."
Other criminal associates.
Ahmed and Muhammad.
Christopher Moltisanti considers them not to be terrorists. He says that Ahmed was angry at the protestors over the "Jyllands-Posten" Muhammad cartoons controversy, not over the cartoons themselves and said that it would bring negative attention to all Muslims. He also mentions that Muhammad's brother is a military interrogator stationed over in Lebanon or Syria fighting the war on terror, labeling them both as "gun nuts." Muhammad also has a girlfriend who has a pet Springer Spaniel. Moltisanti stopped hearing from them and Tony saw that they were associating with other Muslims dressed in traditional Arab clothing. In the episode "Walk Like a Man," Tony passed their names and Ahmed's cell phone number to the FBI. The FBI agents do not recognize them at first, but later tell Tony they may be involved in terror financing. In the series finale "Made in America," Tony passes details of their merchant bank to Agent Harris hoping to gain information on Phil Leotardo's location in return.
A mobster well known enough by the public and the media for Dr. Elliot Kupferberg to assume that Dr. Melfi was treating him when her real patient was Tony Soprano. It is not known whether he was a paternal relative of Jackie Aprile, Sr. or a member of the DiMeo crime family. Because Dr. Melfi is a psychiatrist, it is assumed by the inquiry by Dr. Kupferberg that Augie Aprile either is known to demonstrate psychotic behavior or anger management issues for needing to actually see a psychiatrist. Then again, it could just be that Dr. Kupferberg is confusing names, and that there is no such character. It is also possible that he is confusing names with the violate Richie Aprile who shows psychotic and violent behavior.
Camillo is perhaps a soldier or a higher-ranked member of the Zucca crime family in Naples, headed by Annalisa Zucca.
A criminal associate of Christopher, sometimes referred to as "Giovanni" and in a payment dispute. Furio and Chris beat him badly in season four and Adriana La Cerva witnesses the beating. Later, in season 5, Adriana is given photos of Cogo's deceased body and she mentions that she knew him.
Debbie was the madam of a brothel visited by Tony Soprano, Paulie Gualtieri, Pussy Bonpensiero, and other members of the DiMeo crime family. Raymond Curto and Detective Vin Makazian were arrested there in 1999. After Vin's suicide, Debbie received some consolation from Tony; and she revealed a long friendship with the troubled Makazian.
He was a wealthy Colombian drug trafficker killed by Paulie Walnuts as a final warning to his organization that they were operating on Soprano family territory. He was running his drug distribution center in the basement of a New Jersey apartment complex. Paulie and Big Pussy also steal a lot of cash from his hotel room. Paulie notifies Tony of Gallegos' death by saying "Juan Valdez has been separated from his donkey", a reference to the Colombian coffee commercials.
Angelo Giacalone was an unseen character referenced by Ray Curto to Agent Sanseverino. In the final moments of his life, Curto implicated Tony Soprano in the murder of an Angelo Giacalone, and claimed to have Tony talking about the hit on tape.
Rusty is a small-time Irish-American Newark, New Jersey drug dealer and book maker who is blamed for the death of a teenage boy by Junior Soprano. The boy is revealed to be the namesake grandson of Junior's tailor, committed suicide during a drug induced psychosis after buying drugs from Rusty. Mikey Palmice, along with Joseph Marino, threw Rusty off a bridge in Paterson in 1999, on behalf of Junior. Rusty was associated with the Larry Barese crew, and was its biggest earner. Larry Boy Barese was angered that Mikey killed Rusty, without approaching him for consultation first, and thought of this as a sign that Junior was abusing his new position as boss of the DiMeo crime family. Following his death, Ray Curto said that Rusty never bathed and was a heroin addict. His death is deemed a suicide as Mikey bribes several witnesses that are hanging out on the bridge to fabricate stories about witnessing Rusty's death.
A Turkish ecstasy dealer who has had some association with Soprano/DiMeo business over the years. He was often found in and around the Crazy Horse club owned by Adriana LaCerva, and initially Furio and Chris were hostile to him and threw him off the premises. With the reassurance of Jackie Jr. he returned to dealing outside the club and was put in the hospital by Furio, in traction with his jaw wired shut. Matush was later recruited as a driver in Jackie Junior's failed robbery of a card game in 2001. He bolted with the car as soon as the robbery went awry leaving Dino Zerilli to be caught and killed and forcing Jackie Jr. to improvise his own escape. He is also a close friend of unfortunate card-game stick up man Carlo Renzi. He is most likely the drug dealer for Jackie Aprile, Jr., Dino Zerilli and Carlo Renzi.
Matush Giamona.
In 2004 Matush had returned to dealing at the Crazy Horse - Ade's drug habit and Furio's disappearance made the club more welcoming. He murdered an upset customer, named Gilbert Nieves, in Ade's office and forced her to help him dispose of the body. Another dealer, Kamal, was also involved. This was recorded by FBI surveillance outside and was instrumental in Ade's attempt to flip Christopher that resulted in her death. In Season 6, Agent Harris, in a conversation with Chris, implied that Matush was either sympathetic to extremist Muslim groups or involved in a terrorist group in some capacity.
Barry Haydu was a Detective-Lieutenant with the Clifton, New Jersey police force for thirty years, until his retirement in 2002. Haydu was the investigating officer in the killing of Dickie Moltisanti. The night he was murdered, he came home from his retirement party wearing a Hawaiian shirt and plastic leis around his neck. Tony told Christopher that Haydu was also responsible for his father's death. According to Tony, Haydu was a heavy gambler with serious debts back when he was a rookie cop. Haydu performed contract killings to stave off his debts and Dickie was named a target for Haydu by "Jilly" Ruffalo after Dickie gouged out Jilly's eye in a prison fight. When Christopher asked why Haydu was allowed to live Tony said that he had been useful, but now that he was retiring his usefulness had come to an end. Christopher remembered being told that it was a cop that killed his father.
Detective Barry Haydu.
Christopher broke into Haydu's home and waited for him to return from his retirement party. Chris surprised Haydu and knocked him out, handcuffing him to a staircase so he could question him. Haydu awoke with Christopher watching "Magnum, P.I.". Haydu denied any involvement in Dickie's death but Chris states that it doesn't really matter because Tony wanted Haydu dead either way. Chris then turns up the volume on the television all the way and proceeds to shoot Haydu twice with his own service pistol. Chris placed the gun back in Haydu's hand staging the crime scene to look like a suicide.
A bodyguard and friend who is in rap artist Massive Genius' crew. He first approached Christopher and Adriana to make an introduction between them and Massive. He also attended the sit down Massive has with Hesh Rabkin.
He is from Newark, New Jersey and refers to Livia Soprano as a proud "New Jerseyean." His heritage can be traced back to Confederation, when his grandfather was a slave on a plantation. His father was a union plumber and belonged to the same union as the one they were extorting. Herman arranged a secret deal with Tony, assisting in a shake down of a construction firm: James organized a group of protesters arguing about being paid low wages because of racial bias. The Soprano associates Sean Gismonte and Matt Bevilaqua then attacked with baseball bats, adding drama to the protest and causing a riot. James and Soprano then split the earnings. Son of the Reverend Herman James, Sr. Attended Livia Soprano's funeral. A friend of Assemblyman Ronald Zellman.
Kamal is a Muslim drug dealer who worked alongside Matush at The Crazy Horse. Helped Matush murder Gilbert Nieves in an argument over drugs in 2004. They are recognized as having murdered Nieves after Adrianna La Cerva walks in and sees them standing over the body.
Eli is the son-in-law of Hesh Rabkin. Made collections for Hesh in Leotardo family territory in 2006. Was attacked by Jimmy Lauria, a Leotardo associate, upon leaving a Chinese restaurant with Hesh — the Leotardo crew did not realize Eli had been acting on Hesh's behalf. Jimmy and two cohorts burned Hesh and Eli out of their car, hit Hesh and beat up Eli. Eli fled into the street and was struck by a taxi in a hit and run. He was hospitalized by the accident for broken ribs and internal bleeding. Hesh mentions that he takes it upon himself to drive Eli to physiotherapy following the hit and run.
Emil is a Czech American, graduated from West Essex High School, and was involved in varsity football at the same time Christopher Moltisanti's cousin was enrolled. He is said to have immigrated to the United States when he was 9. He is a recreational cocaine user. He is murdered by Christopher in Satriale's Pork Store, with the dubious distinction of being the first on-screen casualty in "The Sopranos". Emil's wealthy family is involved in the New Jersey waste management business. At the time of his execution, his family's waste sanitation corporation is involved in a contract bidding war over garbage routes controlled by the Soprano family's front organization, Barone Sanitation. Chris lured him to Satriale's under the pretense of seeking an amicable solution to the problem. Chris calls Emil "Email" several times at Satriale's, before "whacking" him. Chris killed Emil without authorization from the family in an effort to gain recognition and rise through the ranks. Big Pussy helped Chris dispose of the body, and later Chris and Georgie (the bartender/bouncer at the Bing) move the body as Chris becomes paranoid after dreaming about Emil (in "The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti"). They bury the body on the grounds of Pat Blundetto's farmhouse in Kinderhook, New York, from where Chris and Tony Blundetto are forced to move it a third time after the land is sold to developers (in "Cold Cuts"). The bones are broken up and thrown in the bottom of a lake.
He is the estranged brother in law to a French-speaking French-Canadian Quebecer who was supplying Tony Soprano with the expired prescription drug Labetalol shipments that they were smuggling from Canada as newly produced medication at an agreed price. He also speaks Québécois French and is a follower of Bohemian and Rastafari movement culture by having natty dreadlock type hair. Rene had divorced from the Quebecer's sister and as a result the two were involved in a dispute over custody of their child and wants to take the child to Winnipeg, Manitoba where he works as a drummer. It is suggested that he is only battling over custody of their child in a vain attempt to have his wife make amends and come back to him. He is negligent of his alimony and child support checks. The Quebecers agreed to drop the price of the Labetalol if Tony organized someone to "take care of the problem", meaning Rene. Tony appointed Bobby to do the hit. Bobby followed Rene into the laundry room of his apartment building in Ottawa, Canada and shot him in the chest, leaving him choking for breath on the floor. Earlier in the episode Tony had pointed out that Bobby had yet to kill anyone; unlike his father who was referred to as a "Terminator". Bobby then finished the job and shot LeCours in the head, and quickly fled the scene.
Alex is a CPA who is employed at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association in Long Valley, New Jersey involved in a scam defrauding Medicare companies with Hesh and Tony by filing false claims for non-existent clients. Alex is a compulsive gambler. He was reluctant to get involved but was in debt to and had bad mouthed Tony. Alex attempted to run away on foot. Tony chases him across his accounting firm's property with Christopher's car and strikes him with the car. He breaks his leg, after which Christopher and Tony administered a beating for the insult. Hesh and Big Pussy convinced him to participate in the scheme to work off his gambling debt by taking him up to the Great Falls in Paterson and implying that a refusal would get him thrown over.
Vin Makazian was a Newark, New Jersey police detective who fed information to Tony Soprano. Tony also used Vin as an investigator, engaging Vin to find information about Dr. Melfi when Tony first started therapy in 1999. Vin was over-enthusiastic in this role, having misunderstood the relationship between Tony and Dr. Melfi as a romantic one, not a professional one. He tailed her and pulled her car over, beating up her companion unprovoked and chastising her for being out with a man he refers to as "hamburger, when you've got prime rib at home." Vin later told Tony that he had taken photographs of Melfi undressing from outside her home, if he's interested, to which Tony replies with disgust. Vin was responsible for informing Tony that Sal "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero was an FBI informant, prompting Tony's suspicions of Pussy, though this was later seemingly dismissed when Tony found out Vin owed Pussy $30,000 in gambling debts, and Vin would like to see Pussy taken out to absolve him of said debt. He informs Tony about Chris shooting the bakery worker in the foot over making him wait in line.
Vin Makazian.
Makazian frequented an illegal brothel and had a relationship with the madam there. He was arrested at the brothel along with Soprano crime family capo Raymond Curto during a police raid. Vin later committed suicide, by leaping off the Donald Goodkind Bridge shortly after he was released from jail. Tony later visited the madam with whom Makazian had a therapeutic relationship, and she divulges to Tony that Makazian viewed him as a friend and, like Tony, was prone to depression. This leaves Tony depressed with guilt because he had always treated Makazian with disdain and never showed him any respect or kindness.
Vin appeared in the episode "The Test Dream" in Tony's titular dream as Meadow's fiance Finn De Trolio's father.
Slava is the apparent head of the Russian mob and a business associate of Tony Soprano and apparently has a lot of affection for Tony. He runs Tony's money laundering operations and helps him find the Russian taxi driver who attacked Janice Soprano. Later on in Series 3, Tony is concerned about meeting with Slava after Paulie Gualtieri and Christopher Moltisanti botch an attempt to kill Slava's friend Valery. Slava appears unaware of what has happened to Valery when Tony has a meeting with him at his restaurant, but reveals to Tony that they served together in the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation during the First Chechen War in Chechnya and Valery personally killed 16 Chechen Republic of Ichkeria rebels saving Slava's life in the process. Slava tells Tony he loves Valery like a brother but Valery's alcohol and drug abuse deeply hurts Slava and brings shame to Valery's family. This prompts Tony to insist to Paulie Gualtieri that Valery must not be allowed to come back and tell of his ordeal. When Paulie Gualtieri and Christopher Moltisanti fail to find Valery in the Pine Barrens and Tony has to come and rescue them, Tony informs Paulie Walnuts that he will have to take any heat from Slava should Valery return. Valery's fate was never resolved by the end of the series.
Slava Malevsky.
Slava presumably has a wife named Galina that Tony got a Toyota Escalante for, and Slava thanks him for it and asks if Tony can get another. Slava has a daughter named Yelе́na that he says is very smart and he hopes will go to Harvard University.
Though Slava isn't seen again in the series, in "Chasing It", after having a meal with Paulie, Christopher and Bobby, Tony states that he's going to see Slava to liquify some offshore money.
Massive Genius is a successful rapper and music producer. In 1999 he met with Christopher Moltisanti and Adrianna La Cerva by chance at a fast food burger restaurant in New York City, where Chris offended the predominantly black customers by making several racially charged remarks about welfare and food stamps. Massive's crew were ready to start something but a police officer intervened, informing them that Chris was a soldier/associate with the Soprano crew who was soon to be a made man, and that the scuffle would be a bad idea in the long run for the group.
Massive Genius.
Massive approached Chris and invited him to a party at his home; Ade recognized him and insisted they attend. Massive's reasons for starting the association seemed to be twofold — he was interested in Ade and a member of his family had been involved with Soprano advisor/associate Herman "Hesh" Rabkin's former record label and was seeking money for a relative. Massive became involved in Ade's aspirations of becoming a music producer and listened to a demo tape she made. He also had Chris arrange a sitdown with Hesh, wherein it seemed violence might break out; however, Massive instead threatened litigation if payment was not forthcoming. In response, Hesh pointed out that Massive had illegally sampled a song to which Hesh owned the rights, and that if Massive should sue him, he would counter-sue. Massive's response was, "See you in court", but the matter was not mentioned again throughout the series run.
Harold Melvoin (also known as Mel and Hal) is Junior Soprano's lawyer from 1999 to 2004. Following Junior's arrest on Federal Racketeering charges, Mel allows him to use his office to conduct business as it is one of the few places he is allowed to visit while under house arrest. It's also one of the places that the FBI is not allowed to wiretap. Junior uses this to conduct Mafia business.
Harold Melvoin.
He conducts Junior's defense throughout his first RICO trial and helps Junior with such schemes as pretending that a (presumably) minor head injury on the courthouse steps has affected his capacity to stand trial.
After suffering a stroke which affects his ability to speak, Melvoin is fired by Junior, who considers his attorney's weakened condition a reminder of his own mortality.
"Yo-Yo" is a drug dealer who pays points to Christopher early on in his career. It is implied that his nickname comes from his constant usage of a yo-yo on his street corner, though he only makes one appearance in the series. During the war of 1999, Junior Soprano moves in on Christopher's territory and has "Yo-Yo" pay up to him instead. Upon hearing this, Christopher beats "Yo-Yo" on a street corner and says if he pays points to anyone but him that he's "coming back for your thumbs."
Tony Soprano's lawyer. Advises Tony to stay off the street and distance himself from the day-to-day work of his crew — this contributes to Tony's insulating himself by communicating through closely trusted friends whenever possible. He also advises Tony to spend more time in the legitimate businesses, such Barone Sanitation, instead of Bada Bing. In the final episode, "Made in America", Mink informs Tony that the government most likely will indict him on federal weapons charges stemming from the arrest made in "Soprano Home Movies" at the beginning of the season, and it is strongly implied that he could consequently be facing a prison sentence.
Nino is probably a very high ranked member in the Zucca crime family in Naples, headed by Annalisa Zucca. He had a talk with Tony in Naples about Junior's car operation to conduct a new business deal.
Willie was an independent bookmaker in Newark, New Jersey. He is executed by Tony Soprano in 1982 for not paying his protection money to Jackie Aprile, Sr. and buried in the basement of a house that was owned at the time by Old Pete the Zip. The basement was refinished sometime after the murder and a concrete floor was laid down which made the FBI dig him up with pick axes and jackhammers. Tony's father had entrusted Tony to perform the hit to "make his bones", allowing Tony to become a made man shortly thereafter. Paulie Gualtieri accompanied Tony on the hit and said that he performed well, but that he was 'a little shaky' and told his father Johnny Boy that he performed well. In 2007, the authorities began investigating the murder and exhumed Overall's remains from the basement of the house that is still being lived in by a woman. It is alleged by Silvio Dante that Larry Barese gave the FBI the location of the body. The murder was ultimately blamed on the late Jackie Aprile, Sr.
Tony approaches George because he is "basically retired" and someone "everybody trusts." He is member of another one of the five New York Mafia families and knows about the ongoing tensions and battles between the Soprano and Lupertazzi families. Tony reached out to Paglieri to broker a sitdown between Tony and the Lupertazzi crime family administration, as both families trusted him. The location for the sitdown is a salvage yard warehouse. George buys bottled water for the mobsters that nobody drinks. He tells Tony that Butch is not happy with Phil either. He (and two of his associates seen frisking Tony and Paulie at the sitdown) are the only characters on the show who represented a New York family other than the Lupertazzis.
Pino is perhaps a soldier or a higher-ranked member of the Zucca crime family in Naples, headed by Annalisa Zucca.
Raffaelle is perhaps a soldier or a higher-ranked member of the Zucca crime family in Naples, headed by Annalisa Zucca.
Reuben is a Cuban-American associate of the DiMeo crime family who has a fondness towards racing horses. He visits Hesh Rabkin's stables frequently. He and Hesh argue after Reuben compares Christopher Columbus to Hitler and Reuben leaves after they almost come to blows.
An associate of Hesh Rabkin who also works in the Atlantic City, New Jersey casino business with Mohunk Chief Doug Smith. Marty organizes a meeting between Tony Soprano and Chief Doug Smith during the civil unrest over Columbus Day Parade (held historically on October 12). Later Marty organizes a night at the casino for Tony and friends and arranges for them to be flown home in the casino's private helicopter.
Chief Doug Smith is the CEO of Mohank Casino (a pun on the Indian word Mohunk), who has used his tenuous family relative blood ties to Iroquois natives through his marriage to operate under laws that apply to them. Hesh puts Tony in touch with Doug Smith to try and settle a "death watch" at the statue of Christopher Columbus at Columbus Park in Hoboken, New Jersey over the genocide of the Native Americans. They would also lay down in the path of the Christopher Columbus parade later on. The chief is unable to help but gives Tony's crew a fully compensated visit at his casino. He reaches out to Tony to try to help him book Frankie Valli to play the casino. Upon reading about the planned protest in the newspaper Bobby Baccalieri and Silvio Dante disagree voice their opinions disagreeing with the protests.
Theodore "Teddy" Spirodakis is an untidy, obese Greek-American and compulsive gambler. He resides in Boston, Massachusetts. He is killed by Eugene Pontecorvo on orders from Christopher Moltisanti for not paying his gambling debts. He is extremely naive about dealing with organized crime and actually recognized Eugene, greeting him in a friendly manner before he was shot dead, seemingly totally unaware of his outstanding debts to Christopher.
Tanno is perhaps an associate or a soldier of the Zucca crime family in Naples, headed by Annalisa Zucca. He accompanies Furio when he first meets their American guests: Tony, Paulie and Christopher. Christopher immediately notices Tanno's forearms are full of needle puncture wounds. Tanno seems to introduce Christopher to injecting heroin and the two spend the rest of his stay in Italy together, high on heroin and vomiting.
Valery was a member of the Russian mob, acquainted with Tony Soprano through his business association with the organization. Valery was shown as a heavy drinker and volatile alcoholic who got into debt with Silvio Dante. He is fluent in both Russian and English. Valery had a state-of-the-art entertainment system and other modern day commodities in his apartment. Valery's friend and boss Slava Malevsky revealed to Tony that they served together in the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation during the First Chechen War in Chechnya and Valery personally killed 16 Chechen Republic of Ichkeria rebels saving Slava's life in the process. Slava told Tony he loves Valery like a brother, but Valery's alcohol and drug abuse deeply hurts Slava and brings shame to Valery's family.
Valery.
Paulie Walnuts and Christopher Moltisanti visit him at his apartment one morning to collect his payment, where Valery readily handed over the envelope of money and offered the two men vodka. Paulie, however, responded to a perceived slight by being intentionally careless with Valery's electronic equipment, causing a brawl in which the two believed they had killed Valery. They drove out to the Pine Barrens to dispose of him but when they arrived he was awake and had bitten through the tape they used to restrain him. They marched him into the snow to dig his own grave and laughed at him for being poorly dressed in winter, but Valery yelled in his native Russian that the Pine Barrens is nothing compared to the Russian tundra, then attacked an overconfident Paulie and Christopher with the shovel they gave him to dig with and escaped. Christopher and Paulie gave chase, firing as they ran, Paulie seemingly hit Valery in the head, but to the amazement of his pursuers, Valery got back up and continued running. The two men continue looking for him but eventually give up, and realize they're lost in the wilderness. Chris and Paulie then spend a miserable night in an abandoned van in the Pine Barrens. On rescuing the pair, Tony makes it clear that if Valery makes it back to North Jersey alive, it is Paulie who will have to deal with Slava, not him.
Valery's fate after this point is unclear. Valery's body was never found, and Paulie's car was stolen from the remote location where it was parked in the wilderness, although there is no way to tell if it was Valery who stole it, or just some local kids. An HBO promo shows notable characters who have been murdered over the course of the series and does show Valery as having died in this episode, but with a question mark, indicating that there is some doubt about this, as it was never conclusively stated, one way or another. David Chase said in an interview at the actor's guild:
Shylock and known Philadelphia organized crime figure, of Ukrainian descent. He was killed in a car bomb hit that allegedly was plotted by Tony Soprano as a message to settle disputes over some DiMeo family's associates encroaching upon the South Jersey and Philadelphia shy business. FBI agent Skip Lipari makes references to him in a conversation with Sal "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero. Bonpensiero was seen by the FBI having dinner with Wyzchuck few weeks before the car bombing. Big Pussy also tells Lipari that Tony bought a pool table from Wyzchuck.
Ronald Zellman was an Assemblyman (member of the lower house of the state legislature) and acted as a political operative on behalf of the Soprano crime family. He aided them in securing the Esplanade construction contract. Ronald was a friend of the Reverend Herman James Jr. and they attended Livia Soprano's funeral together. Zellman was instrumental in having a traffic cop that gave Tony a speeding ticket removed from patrol and assigned to the evidence locker, where he was no longer eligible for overtime and ends up working in a garden center to make up the lost pay. Tony later regretted this and considered asking Zellman to move him back. But, after the officer displays attitude Tony doesn't like at the garden center (including refusing a large cash tip Tony offers him), Tony tells Zellman, "Fuck 'em." Zellman also helped Tony set up the HUD scam by introducing him to Maurice Tiffen, a friend of Zellman's from his days at the University of Michigan.
Ronald Zellman.
Zellman began dating Tony's ex "comàre", Irina, in 2002. Tony initially gave them his blessing. He later changed his mind, arrived at Zellman's house slightly inebriated, and proceeded to beat a shirtless Zellman with his belt. Irina left Zellman some time after this because he was no longer able to perform in bed after the humiliation. The beating becomes a catalyst for an ugly separation between Carmela and Tony later when a drunken Irina calls Carmela and confesses her previous affair with Tony. Although Tony and Zellman have not been shown meeting since the incident, he apparently is still on the payroll, after he became a State Senator in 2006. His influence allowed A.J. to be released from police custody, with no charges filed, following his failed attempt to kill his great-uncle Junior, in the Wycoff Rehabilitation Clinic.
The beautiful and curvaceous daughter of Zi Vittorio, head of the Neapolitan famiglia which is the Camorra a mafia-like criminal organization, or secret society, in the region of Campania and the city of Naples in Italy. She is also the wife of the acting Camorra boss, Mauro Zucca, who is currently serving a life sentence, and a distant cousin of Tony Soprano.
Annalisa Zucca.
When Tony took over Junior's luxury car "export" business, he went over to visit "Zi" (Uncle) Vittorio in Naples to discuss the parameters of their arrangement. When he finally meets Zi Vittorio, Tony finds that he's a senile, wheelchair-using old man - and it is, in fact, Annalisa who runs the organization now. Tony finds this hard to accept at first, but eventually works out a deal with Annalisa — he would cut the price of the cars he supplies to Naples, in exchange for her to supply him with members of her organization. This resulted in Furio Giunta being sent over to the states, and later, in season six, with Tony being supplied with the hitmen to take care of the hit on Rusty Millio, and Philip "Phil" Leotardo (which resulted in his girlfriend and her father mistakenly getting killed).
Annalisa is known to save her nail clippings, which Tony observed her doing while staying at her home. When he inquired as to why, she explained that she has them burned — if her enemies obtained her nail or hair clippings, she stated they could, "make the evil on you."
Tony also had a brief flirtation with Annalisa while in Italy but she politely avoided his interest, keeping things strictly business. She later on appeared to be a bit more receptive to the idea, while they were in an ancient cave discussing the sibyl and premonitions, but Tony turned her down, saying, "I don't shit where I eat."
A photo of Annalisa and Furio is seen in his bedroom during his housewarming party in the season 4 episode, "The Weight".
Annalisa is last referenced in the sixth season, "Live Free or Die", in which Tony mentions to Chris that she is sending two associates or "tailors", over from Naples to execute or "fit for a suit" Rusty Millio, at the behest of Johnny Sack.
Mauro Zucca is the acting boss of the Neapolitan famiglia in Naples, who is currently serving a life sentence. He is the husband of Zi Vittorio's daughter Annalisa, and also a distant cousin of Tony Soprano.
