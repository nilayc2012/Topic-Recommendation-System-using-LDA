<h1>United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan</h1>

 <p>The United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) is the governmental response to the Convention on Biological Diversity opened for signature at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. The UK was the first country to publish a national Biodiversity Action Plan in 1994.
Following the creation of the UK BAP, devolution, in 1998, led the four countries of the UK (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) to develop their own country strategies for biodiversity and the environment.
There are also Local BAPs (LBAPs). In 2012 the UK BAP was succeeded by the 'UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework', but the work identifying priority species and habitats remains relevant.

The UK BAP website (http://www.ukbap.org.uk/) was in operation between 2001 and 2011, when it was closed as part of a government review of websites. The core content was migrated into the JNCC website.
The National Archives preserves snapshops of UK "BAP" webpages predating publication of the UK Biodiversity Framework, for example copies from 2011 and 2012.
