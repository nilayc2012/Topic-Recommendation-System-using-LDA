 <p>The Security Through Regularized Immigration and a Vibrant Economy Act of 2007 or STRIVE Act of 2007 is proposed United States legislation designed to address the problem of illegal immigration, introduced into the United States House of Representatives (H.R. 1645). Its supporters claim it would toughen border security, increase enforcement of and criminal penalties for illegal immigration, and establish an employment verification system to identify illegal aliens working in the United States. It would also establish new programs for both illegal aliens and new immigrant workers to achieve legal citizenship. Critics allege that the bill would turn law enforcement agencies into social welfare agencies as it would not allow CBP to detain illegal immigrants that are eligible for Z-visas and would grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens with very few restrictions.
At the same time, the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 was being considered in the United States Senate, to much more public attention.
Description.
The STRIVE Act mirrors previous attempts to reach bipartisan support for immigration legislation by combining harsher enforcement policies with new programs for aliens to attain citizenship. For example, the unsuccessful 2005 Secure America Act (also known as the McCain-Kennedy Bill) struck a similar compromise.
Title I - Border Enforcement.
Title I of the STRIVE Act:
Title II - Interior Enforcement.
Tougher criminal penalties.
Title II of the STRIVE Act increases criminal penalties for crimes associated with:
Other provisions.
Title II would also:
Title III – Employment Verification.
Title III of the STRIVE Act mandates that the Social Security Administration create a verification system for employers to authenticate employees' authorization to work. The system would be implemented in phases and must include safeguards to protect privacy and prevent employers from racial profiling.
Title III also creates significant new civil and criminal penalties for hiring unauthorized employees.
Title IV – New Worker Program.
Title IV of the STRIVE Act creates two programs for foreign workers to achieve temporary and permanent citizenship.
H-2C Worker Visa Program.
The Worker Visa Program would establish a new H-2C visa for future immigrant workers and their families. The temporary visa would be valid for three years and renewable one-time for an additional three years. Employers may hire these new immigrant workers only if they are unable to find a qualified American worker and only if they are located in an area with an unemployment rate lower than 10 percent for workers whose education level is at or below a high school diploma.
The visa program has an initial cap of 400,000, which adjusts up or down yearly based on market fluctuations. 
Applicants for a H-2C visa must meet the following requirements:
It includes labor rights and protections for new workers including: 
The H-2C visa would take effect one year after the enactment of the Strive Act. Congress would be required to enact implementation regulations within six months.
Earned Citizenship.
The Earned Citizenship Program provides new immigrant workers (and their spouses and children) with an opportunity to apply for conditional permanent residence and eventual citizenship.
Requirements for Earned Citizenship
Title V – Visa Reforms.
Title V of the STRIVE Act makes certain reforms to the US visa system in order to increase the rate of immigration and reduce inefficiency. 
These reforms include adjustments to annual numerical visa limits such as:
Title V also provides for special immigration benefits for victims of a major disaster or emergency. It also provides a special immigration status for women and children deemed to have a credible fear of harm in their home country.
Title VI – Legalization of Illegal Aliens.
Title VI of the STRIVE Act provides two new programs for certain qualified illegal aliens to acquire citizenship. These programs mirror the ones in Title IV of the STRIVE Act, but are for illegal aliens rather than new or prospective immigrant workers.
Conditional Nonimmigrant Program.
The Conditional Nonimmigrant Program creates a new six-year visa for illegal aliens and their families.
Requirements for Conditional Nonimmigrant Status:
There is a penalty of up to five years' imprisonment for anyone who willfully falsifies information in an application for conditional nonimmigrant status.
Earned Citizenship.
The Earned Citizenship Program for Undocumented Individuals provides qualified conditional nonimmigrants and their families with an opportunity to apply for lawful permanent resident status (green card) and eventual citizenship.
Applicants must:
Some additional features of the Earned Citizenship Program for Undocumented Individuals are:
Other provisions.
Title VI includes the following acts:
Title VI also creates grant programs to assist new workers and to address poverty in Mexico.
Title VII – Miscellaneous.
The bill also would increase resources for the immigration court system, provide relief for immigrant victims of the 9-11 attacks and their families, and facilitate naturalization for members of the armed forces.
