 <p>Heather Lynn Mac Donald (born 1956) is an American political commentator and journalist described as a secular conservative. She has advocated positions on numerous subjects including victimization, philanthropy, immigration reform, crime prevention, racism, racial profiling, rape, politics, welfare, and matters pertaining to cities and academia. She is a John M. Olin Fellow of the Manhattan Institute. In addition, she is a contributing editor to New York's "City Journal" and a lawyer by training. She has written numerous editorials and is the author of several books. Born in California, she graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover in 1974. In 1978 she graduated from Yale (where she was in Berkeley College). She then attended Cambridge and graduated from Stanford University Law School in 1985.
Positions.
Mac Donald identifies herself as a secular conservative. She has argued that conservative thinking is superior to liberalism by virtue of the ideas alone, and that religion should not affect the argument and is unnecessary for conservatism. She has criticized the notion of treating boys as a new victim group, and criticized universities for seeking to hire so-called "diversity consultants" to help boys succeed. She has criticized welfare and blamed philanthropic institutions such as the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation for suggesting that welfare is a right; in particular, she has criticized welfare as having a negative impact in the sense that "generations have grown up fatherless and dependent". She has written that welfare programs serve as a "dysfunction enabler" and that food stamps cause an "unhealthy dependence". She has criticized American immigration policy as "importing another underclass", referring to Hispanics, which has the "potential to expand indefinitely". She has argued that the reduction in crime seen in American cities since 1991 is a result of efficient policing, high incarceration rates, more police officers working, data-driven approaches such as CompStat in which police efforts target high-crime areas, and holding precinct commanders accountable for results. On the subject of terrorism prevention, Mac Donald has defended the Patriot Act and argued a case for secrecy and speed in handling problems as well as the sharing of information between departments within the intelligence community, and advocated that the benefits of government power be balanced against the risks of abuse. She has advocated for religious profiling by the police on the grounds that "you cannot be an Islamic terrorist unless you're a member of the Muslim faith". She has said that the Abu Ghraib prison scandal's fallout was overblown and that opponents of then-President Bush used it to construct an exaggerated "master narrative"; she said that Abu Ghraib was "torture lite" compared with more brutal atrocities such as those of Pol Pot. She defended using torture as an interrogation technique as being necessary in selected circumstances.
In a break with some other conservatives, she has criticized talk radio for fueling "heightened rhetoric" and argued that criticism of President Obama on talk radio programs was overdone. She views Obama as a moderate or "standard-issue" liberal, not a radical. She has also condemned conservative "hate gestures", such as an incident in which the doors and windows of Democrats who voted in favor of a health care bill were broken, as "cowardly and juvenile" acts.
She has been a very vocal critic of the Black Lives Matter movement, and was among the first proponents of the "Ferguson effect". She is also an outspoken critic of criminal justice reform, such as the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which she testified against in October 2015.
Reviews of her books.
Critic Robin Finn of the "New York Times" described her as an "influential institute thinker". Columnist George F. Will praised her thinking about urban problems. "New York Times" critic Allen D. Boyer gave a positive review of her book, "The Burden of Bad Ideas" (2000), writing "among discussions of urban malaise, where so much hot air has been recycled, this book has the freshness of a stiff, changing breeze".
