 <p>Playboy TV (originally The Playboy Channel) is an American pornography premium cable and satellite television network that is owned by the Manwin Group, a division of MindGeek, Incorporated. Its programming focuses mainly on softcore and some hardcore adult erotica, including motion pictures, first-run television series and specials. The channel is available internationally in countries such as Sweden, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Latin American countries, New Zealand, Greece, Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Norway.
Background.
The channel launched on November 1, 1982 as The Playboy Channel. It was originally owned by Playboy Enterprises in partnership with Cablevision Systems Corporation, which eventually sold its interest in the channel back to Playboy in 1986. The original programming and style of the Playboy Channel was developed by Hugh Hefner and Michael Trikilis. Playboy hired its own sales and marketing staff and launched the channel on several major multiple system operators. At the time of its launch, programming featured on the channel consisted only of R-rated films. The channel re-launched as Playboy TV and adopted its current name on November 1, 1989, and originally broadcast for only ten hours each day, from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. ET, during its first eleven years of existence. The network expanded its programming with the adoption of a 24-hour schedule in 1994.
The staff, led by Lahoucine "Al" Reddad, included Mbarek "Mark" Hassounya. Reddad launched Playboy in the hotel markets as a pay-per-view service. Playboy TV has become a leading entertainment channel for adult entertainment. In 2011, Playboy Enterprises sold the channel to MindGeek; the Playboy name remains in use by the channel under a brand licensing agreement.
Programming.
The programming content on Playboy TV is more explicit than the softer material of its magazine counterpart. Although it initially broadcast softcore content (with any hardcore footage edited out), in recent years, Playboy TV has begun showing sex acts including oral and vaginal penetration in some programs, without showing any explicit ejaculation or anal sex. This is due to Playboy TV's programming policy, which reflects a desire to produce material that can be used in countries and U.S. jurisdictions (notably Utah) that restrict what can be shown on television, although less Uncensored material is shown on the Playboy website.
Some programs that do contain sex acts are also done in a way that is characteristic of Playboy, such as "Sexy Urban Legends", a show where two young men give their humorous accounts of urban legends that are related to sexual situations. Other series, such as "Foursome" and "7 Lives Xposed" are more explicit and show non-simulated sexual activity, with varying degrees of explicitness. "Naughty Amateur Home Videos", for its first few seasons, edited out footage showing any penetration from the viewer-supplied videos, but in the early 2000s began showing uncensored hardcore footage (though, in keeping with network policy, explicit ejaculation and anal sex are not shown). "Playboy TV Double Features", which start at 11 p.m. Eastern Time in the United States, are also uncut hardcore movies; however, they too follow the programming policy standard. Recently as of January 2008, the Nooner movies have included hardcore scenes as per the same standards as the nighttime block.
Programs featured on Playboy TV's primetime schedule range from couples-driven reality shows ("Brooklyn Kinda Love") to unscripted comedic content ("The Stash"), to full-length movies ("Playboy TV Double Features"). In 2010, the network unveiled a new slate of TV For 2 programming, which featured a selection of series tailored to both male and female audiences. That year, it also began airing classic sexploitation films such as "Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens" and "Cherry, Harry & Raquel!".
Many of the more popular Playboy TV shows that are no longer in production, such as "Night Calls" and "Naked Happy Girls", continue to be available on the network's subscription video on demand services.
