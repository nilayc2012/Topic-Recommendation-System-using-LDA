 <p>Two Twisted is an Australian TV mystery anthology drama which premiered on the Nine Network on 14 August 2006. Narrated by Bryan Brown, who also produced the series' predecessor, "Twisted Tales", each episode of the series contains two short half-hour stories, that have a twist ending. Also present in each episode is a link or connection between the two tales.
Rather than draw on a pool of experienced writers, the producers of the series issued a call to up-and-coming writers to submit screenplays. Some 2,400 entries were received and from these, 14 finalists were chosen. Directors were chosen in a similar fashion. A mix of experienced and emerging directors were chosen to shoot each episode.
Each episode was shot over a period of four days with each director given another four days to edit.
