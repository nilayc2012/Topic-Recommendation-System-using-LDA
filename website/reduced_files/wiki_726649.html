After searching for his father in Utah for a few weeks, Zach Young finally returns home to find his father anxiously awaiting his return. After becoming re-settled with domestic life, Zach asks his father if what Felicia had said about his birth mother was indeed true. Paul nods and tells him that they were just trying to give him a better life. Zach then asks if he knows who his real father is. Paul tells him that he does not know who he is. However his actual biological father lives a few doorsteps away. Days later, Paul knocks on Mike's door to tell him that Zach is home and to leave them alone.

Bree arrives at George's home to learn from the police that George has committed suicide in a hotel room shortly after his home invasion. Bree looks surprised at the police officer's news but becomes even more amazed when the police ask her if several garments of underwear belong to her. The police take a mannequin out of George's study that has a likeness to that of Bree. When Bree asks if that is supposed to be her, the detective tells her that according to his belongings, George was quite perverse. Detective Barton then advises her to tell her family and friends the truth of her relationship with George before a leak is released to the press. She proceeds to tell Susan, Gabrielle and Lynette who feel bad for Bree since George was poisoning Rex. Andrew then returns home from deprogramming camp in a jeep. Bree tells him what happened with George and that his father was murdered in order for George to marry Bree. Andrew is very upset at this revelation and promises to have his revenge on Bree. Against Bree's will he decides to invite Justin to spend the night. As the two play video games, Andrew tries to kiss Justin. But Justin says to wait a little while, and that he'll make it worth Andrew's while. Andrew then tells Justin that he wished his mom would walk in on them, as part of how he plans to bring Bree down. The following morning, Bree tells Andrew about how George really died and Andrew plots to use it against her in the future as part of his plan for revenge.
During a church meeting aimed at improving the water situation in Botswana Gabrielle learns that Sister Mary Bernard will not be able to go there due to a lack of funds. She agrees to put up the $8000 so that Sister Mary can go there and leave Carlos alone for a few months. Sister Mary asks Carlos to come anyway since she will need a "male companion". Gabrielle scoffs at this and forgets to tell a nurse about Carlos' allergies to eggs during his vaccinations. Carlos has an allergic reaction to the Yellow fever vaccine and is forced to stay in bed, thus missing the missionary trip. As Gabrielle holds Carlos in bed, he complains about how hot the village is and moans the name "Sister Mary".
Susan tries to build her relationship with her father Addison by showing him pictures from her life. Addison bores easily over the pictures which include a Halloween where she was dressed as a chicken or when she had to go to the Father-Daughter dance with her mother's hairdresser. Addison tells Susan he has to leave and asks if they are done. Susan feels rushed and asks where he is going. Addison proceeds to take the "hobo picture" and runs off. Susan does not receive a phone call from Addison until he is arrested for soliciting to a prostitute who was actually an undercover cop. Susan tells Addison how ashamed she is and goes to pay his bail money. After dropping him off, Addison's wife, Carol sees them together and writes down Susan's license plate. The following morning, Susan goes out to get her newspaper and finds "WHORE" written in dark red lettering on her garage door. Susan then calls Addison who comes over and tells her that it was definitely the work of Carol. Susan then runs into Carol at the grocery store and tries to explain her situation but Carol does not want to hear it and starts to throw groceries at her. Only when Susan says that Addison is her father she stops and becomes saddened over the fact that Addison has been unfaithful since the beginning. Susan comforts Carol who leaves and tells her that Addison isn't as good as he seems. The next day, Susan paints over her garage door as Addison drops by. He tells her that he would not mind seeing her again since she has been so good to him and that he was being rude. Susan agrees and invites him to call whenever he is in the mood.
Lynette tries to create a company day care center when she spends yet another night without seeing her kids. Her boss Ed agrees and Lynette tells him that they need at least 16 children to seek approval. Lynette has 15 so far but needs one more child to make the day care official. Ed then tells her that his daughter Mindy could come but that they would have to ask his wife Fran if that would be all right. When Lynette meets with Fran, she tells her straight the criteria of the day care and that Mindy would not be required to stay the entire day. Fran tells Lynette that she objects since she "loves spending time with Mindy". Ed plans to go to desperate measures to ensure that they receive the quota. The following morning, Ed brings Mindy to work without Fran's consent which leads Fran to show up and ask what is going on. As the two quarrel, Lynette takes Mindy into her office and locks the door behind her. Lynette tells Ed that what he did was stupid and advises them that they need better ways of communication in order to get what they want. Fran admits that she does get tired now and then and that maybe day care is not such a bad idea. Lynette agrees and recommends that the two talk about the situation in the lobby over coffee. The next week, day care is in session and Lynette is happy to see baby Penny during her break.
